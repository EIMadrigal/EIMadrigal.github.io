        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>这是Steve在2005年Stanford毕业典礼上的<ahref="https://www.npr.org/2011/10/06/141122856/steve-jobs-speech-at-stanford-university">演讲</a>，很多内容深情流露，发人深省，特摘录于此，<ahref="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1oW411h7Ea">视频在这里</a>。当然这并不意味着我认可他所有的做法，或者想成为他那样的人（我也没那个能力哈哈）。</p><p>以下是全文：</p><p>Thank you. I'm honored to be with you today for your commencementfrom one of the finest universities in the world.</p><p>Truth to be told, I never graduated from college, and this is thecloest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.</p><p>Today, I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. Nobig deal. Just three stories. The first story is about connecting thedots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but thenstayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I reallyquit. So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My biologicalmother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me upfor adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by collegegraduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by alawyer and his wife.</p><p>Except that when I popped out, they decided at the last minute thatthey really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list,got a call in the middle of the night asking: We've got an unexpectedbaby boy. Do you want him? They said: Of course. My biological motherfound out later that my mother had never graduated from college and thatmy father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign thefinal adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when myparents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in mylife.</p><p>And 17 years later, I did go to college. But I naively chose acollege that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of myworking-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.<strong>After 6 months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no ideawhat I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going tohelp me figure it out.</strong> And here I was spending all of the moneymy parents had saved their entire life. <strong>So I decided to drop outand trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at thetime, but looking back, it was one of the best decisions I evermade.</strong></p><p>The minute I dropped out, I could stop taking the required classesthat didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that lookedfar more interesting. <strong>It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have adorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms. I returned Cokebottles for the five-cent deposits to buy food with, and I would walkthe 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a weekat the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled intoby following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless lateron.</strong></p><p>Let me give you one example. Reed College, at that time, offeredperhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout thecampus, every poster, every label on every drawer was beautifullyhand-calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take thenormal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to dothis. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying theamount of space between different letter combinations, about what makesgreat typography great.</p><p>It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way thatscience can't capture, and I found it fascinating. <strong>None of thishad even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten yearslater, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all cameback to me. And we designed it all into the Mac.</strong> It was thefirst computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in onthat single course in college, the Mac would have never had multipletypefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copiedthe Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.</p><p>If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on thatcalligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderfultypography that they do. <strong>Of course, it was impossible to connectthe dots looking forward when I was in college, but it was very, veryclear looking backwards 10 years later.</strong></p><p><strong>Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward. You canonly connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dotswill somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something,your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever, because believing that thedots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to followyour heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that willmake all the difference.</strong></p><p>My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky，I found what Iloved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garagewhen I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from justthe two of us in a garage into a 2 billion dollar company with over 4000employees. We'd just released our finest creation, the Macintosh, a yearearlier, and I just turned 30, and then I got fired. How can you getfired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew, we hired someonewho I thought was very talented, to run the company with me. And for thefirst year or so, things went well. But then our visions of the futurebegan to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, ourboard of directors sided with him. And so at 30, I was out - and verypublicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone,and it was devastating.</p><p>I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I hadlet the previous generation of entrepreneurs down, that I had droppedthe baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and BobNoyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a verypublic failure, and I even thought about running away from the Valley.But something slowly began to dawn on me, I still loved what I did. Theturn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had beenrejected, but I was still in love, and so I decided to start over.<strong>I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired fromApple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. Theheaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being abeginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one ofthe most creative periods of my life.</strong></p><p>During the next 5 years, I started a company named NeXT, anothercompany named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who wouldbecome my wife. Pixar went on to create the world's first computeranimated feature film, "Toy Story", and is now the most successfulanimation studio in the world.</p><p>In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, and I returned toApple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart ofApple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful familytogether. I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn'tbeen fired from Apple. <strong>It was awful-tasting medicine, but Iguess the patient needed it.</strong></p><p>Sometime life - <strong>sometimes life is going to hit you in thehead with a brick, don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thingthat kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find whatyou love, and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers. Yourwork is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to betruly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work, and the onlyway to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found ityet, keep looking and don't settle. As with all matters of the heart,you'll know when you find it. And like any great relationship, it justgets better and better as the years roll on, so keep looking - don'tsettle.</strong></p><p>My third story is about death. When I was 17, I read a quote thatwent something like: <strong>If you live each day as if it was yourlast, someday you'll most certainly be right.</strong></p><p>It made an impression on me. And since then, for the past 33 years, Ihave looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself, If today werethe last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?And whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row, I know Ineed to change something. <strong>Remembering that I'll be dead soon isthe most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the bigchoices in life. Because almost everything, all external expectations,all pride, all fear of embarrassment of failure, these things just fallaway in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoidthe trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked.There is no reason not to follow your heart.</strong></p><p>About a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn'teven know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almostcertainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expectto live no longer than 3 to 6 months. My doctor advised me to go homeand get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die.It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd have thenext ten years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make surethat everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possiblefor your family. It means to say your goodbyes.</p><p>I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had abiopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomachand into my intestines; put a needle into my pancreas and got a fewcells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife who was there told methat when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors startedcrying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancerthat is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and, thankfully, I'mfine now.</p><p>This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's theclosest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can nowsay this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a usefulbut purely intellectual concept, no one wants to die. Even people whowant to go to heaven, don't want to die to get there, and yet...</p><p>...death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it,and that is as it should be, because death is very likely the singlebest invention of life. It's life's change agent. it clears out the oldto make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not toolong from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite true. <strong>Your time islimited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trappedby dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking.Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything elseis secondary.</strong></p><p>When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The WholeEarth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It wascreated by a fellow named Stewart Brand, not far from here in MenloPark, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in thelate 60's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it wasall made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. it was sortof like Google in paperback form 35 years before Google came along. Itwas idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions.</p><p>Stewart and his team put out several issues of the The Whole EarthCatalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a finalissue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover oftheir final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, thekind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.Beneath it were the words, stay hungry. Stay foolish. It was theirfarewell message as they signed off. Stay hungry. Stay foolish. And Ihave always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to beginanew, I wish that for you. <strong>Stay hungry. Stay foolish.</strong>Thank you all very much.</p>]]></content>

      <title>加息二三事</title>
      <link href="/posts/interest-rates/"/>
      <url>/posts/interest-rates/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>从2022年3月开始，美联储在本轮加息周期累计进行了8次加息，累计增加了450个基点，基准利率从0.25%上升到4.75%。就在前几天，商务部表示2023年中国外贸领域的主要矛盾转变为外需走弱、订单下降，从全国港口的集装箱可用指数就可以看出外贸形势的严峻。我来扯扯这中间的联系。</p><p>通常来说，美联储加息的原因是由于经济过热，因为经济过热会导致通胀以及资产泡沫，影响经济稳定性，而加息则是最直接影响市场的货币政策。加息后，企业和个人的贷款成本增加，同时存款利率也增加了，人们倾向于把钱存银行，流通的钱变少，自然经济就降温了。</p><p>加息最直观的影响就是股市债市，都知道美国的蓄水池是股市（据说大于50%），CN自然是房地产（超过70%），加息导致企业借钱成本增加、生意减少，股市下跌，企业损失，美国人财富缩水。</p><p>由于美元结算体系，中国的外汇以美元为主，来源主要有几个方面：</p><ol type="1"><li>企业贸易顺差：出口东西挣回美元，外汇管理局扣下，兑人民币</li><li>外企到中国投资：外汇管理局扣下，兑人民币</li><li>中国企业借的美元债：恒大、碧桂园等，外汇管理局扣下，兑人民币</li></ol><p>外汇的用处大概有：</p><ol type="1"><li>中国企业出海兑换，需要美元在国外买矿</li><li>出国旅游兑换美金</li><li>投资</li></ol><p>一进一出之后，仍然有大量的外汇结余，成为<strong>外汇储备</strong>。手里攥着这么多美金花不出去，怎么办呢？总不能换成卢布吧。比较靠谱的投资方式还是大量购买美国国债，因为美国国债流动性和安全性都很高，收益率也还可以。所以美元最后还是存在美国银行里，变成持有美国国债了。</p><p>而加息以后美元回流，国内的投资等就要把人民币兑换成美元回美国挣钱，但是外汇管理局手里美金不够，只能抛美债给人兑付，同理日本、欧洲都会抛。其他国家做空美国国债，美国政府就没法提高债务上限了，再发没人买了，而美国就是靠发债过日子，这下政府卖不了国债没钱了，最终这些措施传导回美国自己，因此是把双刃剑。对中国来讲，就是资本外流，股市楼市下跌，人民币贬值。</p><p>另外，由于总爱搞关税壁垒和贸易制裁等等，加上俄乌战争导致能源价格和运输成本升高，油气粮食价格上涨，因此加息以后美国物价仍然在上涨，CPI仍然很高，治理通胀的效果并不明显。</p><p>从中国来看，在消费、投资、出口三驾马车中，由于目前内需不振（参考Apple销量），投资面临饱和且风险较大，因此出口变得非常重要。而中国外贸出口趋势性下降，原因主要是：</p><ol type="1"><li>由于美联储加息、疫情、俄乌战争等因素导致的全球经济周期性衰退</li><li>订单流失到越南、印度等成本更低的地方，还有就是没人愿意和反复无常的人长期打交道</li></ol><p>因此，我对外企在大陆的前景持悲观态度（我不会失业吧...）。另外，由于一直以来对中国的贸易、芯片等的制裁，导致大陆只能换供应商，因此大陆对台湾的贸易逆差会继续增大。</p><p>参考<br /><ahref="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/fed-raises-interest-rates/">WhatHappens When The Fed Raises Interest Rates?</a></p>]]></content>

      <title>寒气逼人的秋招</title>
      <link href="/posts/interview-summary/"/>
      <url>/posts/interview-summary/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>自从8月13日开始第一场笔试，到11月15日最后一场面试，耗时3个多月的秋招终于宣告结束。错失了一些所谓的机会，也浅尝了生活的另一番滋味。offer寥寥，教训良多。</p><h2 id="时代的一朵小浪花">时代的一朵小浪花</h2><p>今年的就业形势不用我多啰嗦，再加上这届硕士大规模扩招，因此秋招的阵仗甚至可以用惨烈来形容。当然寒气其实并不会影响金字塔尖的那群人，只是吹得我等半瓶子晃荡的选手无奈向下兼容。其实3月份找实习的时候，就发现情况不太妙，但由于很幸运地拿到了大厂的实习offer，所以还信心满满，想要在秋招中“乱杀”。</p><p>我的秋招节奏整体上偏晚，8月20日才结束在百度的实习回到学校，因此错过了比较多提前批的机会，复习也开始的比较晚，9月份才有了秋招第一面。由于一直以来都想去外企，再加上实习时感受了下国内所谓互联网大厂的氛围，更加坚定了我的方向，所以开始时我的想法是用国内大厂练练手，主要投递微软、亚麻、Intel、Hulu、虾皮、Zoom等等。但是随着秋招进程的深入，我发现这些公司要么挂我简历、要么挂我笔试，虾皮甚至爆出了裁员丑闻，我才将目光重新转向国内大厂，当然我指的是相对稳定些的公司，比如华子、OPPO、荣耀等等，当然还有一部分原因是我想留在西安。同时也浅投了几家研究所、证券公司和银行。</p><p>面试过程中规中矩，经过3个月的实习，我并没有迸发出进大厂搬砖的激情，相反，我对那种工作环境持否定态度。因此，八股背的不好，项目也答得很烂，由于LeetCode刷了500多题，算法题基本没出啥大问题。这种随缘面试的结果就是：所谓的互联网大厂全挂了哈哈哈。10月中旬拿了TP以后，就开始拒笔试和面试了，把还在面试流程中的走完就可以了。</p><p>最终：过了2个小外企，虽然特别的wlb，但是钱太少，拒了。还有一些点击就送的厂子，特别点名表扬比亚迪，今年的秋招之光，没有她估计一半人得失业。最后选了另一个外企消磨余生，还是挺满意的。</p><p>我自己的找工作之旅已经到达终点，对后来同学的一些小tip：</p><ol type="1"><li>有些学历厂的提前批一定不要错过，往往能拿到sp。</li><li>不同的公司有不同的面试风格：美团喜欢数据库，阿里百度喜欢刨项目，字节喜欢考算法。因此面经尤其是同部门的面经非常重要，极大概率会遇到原题。</li><li><strong>项目的深度远比广度更加重要，一些拓展思考以及开源实现要有所了解，ToyProject最好能从最基本的实现方式，一步步改进和优化。如果不是独立项目，一定要清楚项目的整体逻辑和自己负责模块的位置及价值。</strong>我自己简历上的项目没有吃的特别透，所以聊项目时总是稍稍有点怯。</li></ol><h2 id="流水账">流水账</h2><h3 id="找实习">找实习</h3><p>参考胡神博客</p><ol type="1"><li>国内大厂：关于实习期间的心路历程，可以看<ahref="https://eimadrigal.github.io/posts/internship-summary/">这里</a></li><li>外企：</li></ol><h3 id="秋招">秋招</h3><ol type="1"><li>国内大厂：</li><li>外企：</li></ol><p>最后拿到的offer有：</p><p>外企：Lenovo，Samsung，Morgan Stanley国内：中兴，比亚迪，深信服，TP，广联达，OPPO，科大讯飞，华为，荣耀</p><p>包括了一些sp和ssp，</p><p>整体来讲，外企的面试体验都非常棒，</p><h2 id="学而不思">学而不思</h2><p>人生的路还很长，第一份工作比较重要，但也没那么重要。对我而言，比较迫切的事情就是尽快确定一个system的小方向深入钻研，<strong>深入参与一些大型的开源项目或者自行实现一些demo并一步步优化，贪多嚼不烂。</strong></p><h2 id="吐槽时间">吐槽时间</h2><p>洗脚大9月16日就开了三方，因此秋招过程中面临了很多逼签，关于这所学校的种种劣迹我不想一一阐述，总结起来就是：坑学生永远第一名。</p><p>最后，是时候好好搞毕设了😵</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>昨天是我结束在百度实习的日子，这是我第一次真正意义上在互联网公司实习，对我来说是一段全新的体验，回想起这三个多月，感慨良多，不吐不快。</p><h2 id="技术成长">技术成长</h2><p>我是在公共技术团队下的数据分析小团队搬砖，实习期间主要负责内部一个分析平台的设计、开发、测试和运维，平台的功能类似于字节的<ahref="https://www.volcengine.com/docs/6285/65957">火山引擎</a>，平常的大部分工作都是CURD，当然也经常化身为SQLBoy。从技术深度上来讲，这些工作的难度甚至远远不如我做过的一些公开课Lab，也并没有十分复杂的算法。我个人肉眼可见的一些成长主要包括：</p><ul><li>对于大厂开发流程有了深入的了解，包括需求设计、排期、前后端联调、部署上线等，由于公司正在降本增效，因此我得以接触到全流程的每个步骤，甚至作为主力开发成为了平台代码最大的贡献者。在这些过程中，对于一些大数据的开源/自研工具有了初步的使用经验，比如Spark，ClickHouse，Pingo，AFS等。</li><li>对于国内的互联网公司而言，技术永远是为业务赋能的，顺便，学到了对齐、拉通、赋能、抓手这些互联网黑话。分析平台看似简单，其实底层的整条数据链路是非常复杂的，需要各种端的协作以及对业务的深层理解，在公司内部的推进还是需要高T去协调资源的。对于类似于数据研发/数据分析/基础平台研发这种支持性岗位，在晋升时和业务部门一起PK是十分吃亏的，但是相对来讲比较清闲，算是各有利弊吧。</li><li>根据我的观察，百度还算是一家技术导向的公司，内部基建也比较完善，牛人也很多，没落主要是其他因素导致的。</li><li>需求排期非常紧，完全没时间把控代码质量，除非你愿意牺牲休息时间重构代码，可是又有什么收益呢，所以只能屎山上雕花。很难静下心做一些底层基础的事情，比如代码质量等，最重要的是迅速地跑起来。</li><li>OKR制度确实可以提效，可以借鉴来制定自己的目标。</li><li>技术选型以及参数格式的设计在初期非常重要，会极大程度影响后续开发迭代。</li><li>及时commit代码，将功能需求拆分成很小的story，例如controller打好桩提交一次，service实现一个功能提交一次，这样容易定位bug，也便于别人review代码。这一点我做的不好，总是一次提交成百上千行代码，幸好mentor没有打死我。。</li><li>不要随便删除别人的代码：有一次没仔细看删了一个mentor写的重载函数，结果CR时被骂的狗血淋头，因为参数的个数虽然一样，但顺序和意义不一样。。</li></ul><h2 id="人情练达">人情练达</h2><p>这几个月能明显感觉到自己在职场上的沟通交流亟待加强，主要有以下几点：</p><ul><li>印象非常深刻的一件事：有一个用户包分享的需求，我在实现之前没有和mentor沟通技术方案，给表加了一个字段，通过位运算判断分享到的APP，完成后进行CR时mentor告诉我有更好的方案，可以用中间表，因此很多代码都需要重写。。这个惨痛的故事告诉我们：对于一些稍大的功能优化，实现前一定要沟通好技术方案，避免返工。</li><li>职场第一课：除了技术方案，其他事情也要及时沟通和汇报，不要拖太久，避免出事和背锅。</li><li>正确理解领导的意思：由于平台使用人数增加，小组长让我部署一个线上环境，告诉我要确保jar包等配置、测试MySQL的连接、判断Pingo任务是否提交成功、设置数据库和离线任务的白名单、搞成一键部署的脚本...当时就给我整懵逼了，我心想我靠这咋弄。但是后来我揣摩了下组长的目的：说了这么多很专业的词汇，其实最终就是希望线上和测试环境分离，其实就是把原来的数据库啥的copy一份，改下maven的配置，清理下垃圾数据就ok了，最终互不影响就行，事情瞬间简单了。</li><li>领导的记忆力都是很好的，可能几个月前给你的一个小任务，几个月后的周会上他还能清楚地找你要结果，不要抱有侥幸的偷懒心理。</li><li>不得不承认一个残酷的事实，我们和大部分人都只是利益交换关系而已，不过学生之间利益牵扯少一些而已。职场上以自己利益为主要操作方向，更有侵略性一些，不要掺杂感情因素。mentor教育我：职场没有感情，关系再好也只是同事间的利益而已，公司裁你的时候眼睛都不会眨一下。</li><li>虽然如此，但还是要搞好同事关系，晋升时候指不定谁就是答辩委员会的，包括同一批入职的。</li><li>百度有些老鸟真的很烦人，素质很低。</li></ul><p>我的两位mentor教会了我挺多东西，尤其是晓燕姐，在我刚入职时候不知道从何下手时鼓励我大不了推倒重来，告诉我数据做到极致就是让人感受不到数据组的存在，教我思考不可替代性和自己的价值，公司为啥用你而不用更廉价的人。涛哥开始给我的印象很不好，但是后来接触多了发现他的确是一个非常规范的职场人，印象颇深的是8月10号午饭后遛弯，他问我团队为什么要做这个平台，我说了提高影响力等等，他告诉我这些都对，但显然说服力不够，说服别人需要定量的数据，如平台的需求覆盖率分析，这是建立在高层次的认知基础上的，因此年轻时还是卷一点，技术是学不完的，但是可以更快到达更高的认知层次，看问题更加全面，以后会轻松一些。</p><h2 id="感性碎片">感性碎片</h2><p>这篇文章最开始的标题是『大厂再无光环』，后来随着实习的深入，我发现这个题目并大不合适。不去亲身体验根本不知道自己是不是真的喜欢和适合。刚入职的体验确实非常不好：坐在工位，看着满屏的代码，砸着有些酸疼的腰椎。从早到晚都在嗡嗡嗡，打语音对需求，午休还有人叽叽喳喳，脑袋一整天都是僵硬的，感受到的全是痛苦。有的人就是可以在这种环境中如鱼得水，兴奋地找Bug。而我感觉像是彻彻底底地活在梦里，自己完全不属于自己，也完全没有解决技术难题的喜悦感，每天都在忙碌着开会肝需求。一天中最开心的时刻就是下班回出租屋的路上，一个人带着耳机听着歌。</p><p>这种感觉是极其压抑的，这辈子不想再碰这些了，每天很痛苦，盯着屏幕一整天，感觉不到任何乐趣。难是一方面，还有就是一天看代码真的受不了，需求叠着需求，没有松口气的时候，整天写代码我就疯了。我暗暗发誓并且120%地确定：这绝对不是我想要的生活，绝望了，身体或心理上最难受最绝望的时候甚至有些生不如死的感jio。其实CS（特指码农这份工作）更像物理而非数学，更偏向实用科学而非理论科学，我从小就不擅长动手，根本不是技术控。</p><p>现在仍然清晰地记得：6月14号晚上下班后，走在路上我几乎濒临崩溃，在💴和痛苦之间苦苦挣扎，不知道何去何从。彷佛前几年做的一切，都是虚空甚至起了反作用。坐在回龙观新村的长椅上，抬头仰望夜空，却满眼都是乌云。我当时想：房子和付出的成本都不是最关键的问题，只要让我立即辞职止损就好！</p><p>6月17号是一个周五，天气好闷热，完全一副暴雨将至的样子，当时的情况就和我的心情一样压抑。我交完代码后，于7.30冲出公司，快步向回走，半路碰到共享单车，听着《淤青》，终于在下雨前赶回出租屋。我发誓这个周末一定要搞清楚未来的路。当时和npy在冷战，真的特别想哭，如果真的下雨了，我又该找谁借把伞呢？好吧，后来知道公司可以借伞。</p><p>度过了最初期的两周，逐渐适应了社畜的生活，最开心的就是周五周六，周天最不开心，因为第二天就又要上班了。我住在19楼，18楼有一个大爷，每天早晨上班他都会在单元楼门口，每天晚上下班他也在。组里和我关系最好的不是经理，也不是mentor，而是组里另外一个小哥，他帮我debug带我看源码，可惜我入职不到2周他就走了，休假前最后一天他才告诉我自己是被裁员的，他说一开始没告诉我是被裁员，因为我刚去，不想打击我。小哥说话不多，但是比组里留下的两个人热心的多，也许这种机制就是让这些无情的工作机器留下吧。他走的那天下午(0623)，我真的非常失落，走在路上的一瞬间特别想哭，眼泪一下就用到了眼眶，那种难过的感觉，我在想，如果走的是我，我是否有他那么乐观，有重新开始的勇气。</p><p>后面就彻底适应了这种生活，即使很多事情(科研，实习，找工作，人际)交织在一起，我的心理压力也没有刚去的时候那么大。</p><p>lastday时，再也看不到西二旗熙熙攘攘的自行车流，看着离职交接流程一项项审批(36/42)，入职时候工位放的半杯水在离职时也正好蒸发完，离职这天上厕所也不用盯着如流慌慌张张。离开北京的前一晚，我心里五味杂陈，有不舍、有茫然、有畏惧、有期待。人如果对未来几天的将要发生的事情有一些期待，那么当下的生活也会美妙很多。</p><p>再见了，后厂村不息的早高峰！再见了，回龙观舒适的晚风！</p><figure><img src="回龙观.jpg" alt="码农大本营回龙观新村" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">码农大本营回龙观新村</figcaption></figure>]]></content>

class="math inline">\([0,2^{32}-1]\)</span>.对于存储请求, 将<code>hash(obj)</code>利用二分法顺时针分配到第一个节点,从而提高<strong>单调性</strong>, 即增删节点后,原有数据的哈希结果不迁移或迁移到新节点, 但不会迁移到旧节点.在Swift云存储系统中, 负责存储对象与物理位置映射关系的组件叫做Ring,也许就有环hash的意思.</p><figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Positive Psychology是Havard开设的一门心理学课程,这门2003年的课程解开了我相当多的疑惑,是我研究生三年中上过的最重要的一门课. 在2021年6月左右就刷过一遍,时至今日仍然常看常新.</p><h2 id="成长第一问-人生的意义是什么">成长第一问: 人生的意义是什么</h2><p>我想在每个人成长的过程中, 都会或早或晚从某一时刻开始, 不停追问自己:人生的意义是什么? 我大概从初中开始想象: 既然人终归都要西去,那么每天努力学习又有什么用呢? 这个问题一直萦绕在我心头,时而觉得已经靠近答案了, 时而推翻曾经的答案. 犹记得大学室友说:人生的意义就是没有意义, 人生就是用来追寻意义的. 看起来很有哲学意味,但切记: 汝之蜜糖, 吾之砒霜.</p><p>随时间流逝, 我也变得忙碌起来, 不过还是会经常思考:辛勤工作挣大钱有什么用? 勾心斗角追名逐利又有什么用? 到头来不都是一场空?所以有段时间我变得十分佛系, 并且经常感到生活如同行尸走肉,只是在为了一个目标机械式地付出时间精力. 就像Thoreau和Floyd所说:</p><blockquote><p>Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.<br />People are comfortably numb.</p></blockquote><p>幸福感这个词虽然偶尔仍然会在耳边闪现:</p><blockquote><p>人生嘛, 最重要的就是开心!</p></blockquote><p>但彼时对于幸福的理解却完全是二元的: 要么幸福, 要么不幸.从来没有想过幸福感竟然可以是连续的, 是可以有比较级的: happier.因此人的情感不可能永远维持在高位, 每段时间都会有ups and downs,但是通过科学的方法可以让自身的幸福感呈现出总体上的上升趋势,而这则应当是衡量人生意义的唯一标准.</p><p>那么人生幸福感的持续增加是否能够依赖他人呢? 或者说是否能够遇到伯乐呢?很不幸, 概率极低. 我以前低谷时, 总是幻想会有人来拯救自己,但往往事与愿违, 直到最后也不会神兵天降. 所以抱怨和幻想都无济于事,正如Tal所言:</p><blockquote><p>No one is coming. You are responsible for your life, for yourself-confidence, for your self-esteem, for your happiness.</p></blockquote><h2 id="认知误区之成功">认知误区之成功</h2><p>如果用实现某些人生节点的目标来作为成功的标准,正如我们小时候一直被教育的那样: 考上好大学就是成功,抑或是拿到tenure就算成功. 我相信: 你原本想象成功后就会永远高兴下去,比如考到所谓的好学校便会一帆风顺. 但事实往往是:这样快乐的情绪并不会持续太久, 接踵而来的便是新的烦忧,即幸福感会很快回落到之前的baseline. 同样地, 失败也会是相同的感受:你以为自己会很长很长时间处于低落情绪中, 但其实没过几天就会走出阴霾.</p><p>因此, 在基本的物质和精神需求得到满足后,外界因素对于幸福感的影响其实是很小的.幸福感baseline更多取决于自己的state of mind, 取决于如何看待世界,看待发生的事情.</p><h2 id="关于理想主义">关于理想主义</h2><p>曾经在很长一段时间里, 我都自诩为理想主义者,但后来我发现自身的认知有些偏差, 我顶多算个半理想主义者.理想主义者要有理想, 这只是前提,是否拥有足够的勇气和智慧去践行理想才是区分理想主义者与否的关键:</p><blockquote><p>To be idealistic is to be realistic.</p></blockquote><p>这个世界最最需要的是有实践精神的理想主义者:</p><blockquote><p>What the world needs more than anything else is practicalidealists.</p></blockquote><p>很不幸, 目前看来我并不具备这样的勇气和智慧. 我之前还有一点疑问:对于那些所谓精致的利己主义者, 或者说只顾自身幸福的人我是持鄙夷态度的,但很明显这样看起来并不正确:</p><ol type="1"><li>追求自身幸福并不是一种自私的行为, 幸福感是正和博弈, 是具有传染性的:助人即是助己, 助己也是助人.因此传播幸福最好的方法就是经营好自己的幸福.</li><li>作为伪理想主义者, 我自然没有资格评判别人的行为.</li><li>目前某些国家的大环境的确没有理想主义者生存的土壤.</li></ol><h2 id="关于完美主义">关于完美主义</h2><p>我从小就有完美主义的毛病, 小到考试要将卷子写满, 大到人生决策全都想要.我甚至曾经一度认为这是一个好的习惯: 追求完美, 追求绝对纯净.栽过几次跟头后我隐约觉得这种认知不对, 但是无法科学剖析.</p><p>完美主义者通常更加看重未完成的事, 看重缺点错误, 急于做出改进.正因为如此, 这类人经常忽略自己的优势和成就, 忽略过程的享受,更容易成为所谓的rat racer. 另外, 总是会后悔: 如果当初选了那条路,结果会不会不一样? 这种All or Nothing的思想是病,是一种对充斥于生活中的失败的一种失能性恐惧, 尤其对于我们所关心的方面.看得越认真, ta就伤害你越深. 另外, 通常会很急躁地,仓促地急于完成这些所谓很重要的事, 最后效果也不好.</p><p>是病就得治:</p><ol type="1"><li>Permission to be human. 你是人, 不是神, 给自己一个做凡人的空间.尽人事知天命, 随ta去吧.</li><li>从A点到B点一定是蜿蜒曲折的, 不存在最短的直线, 否则就违反了天性.如果你希望journey是直达的, 那么你在白日做梦.</li><li>Go coping, go trying, go hearing.</li><li>Learn to fail or fail to learn. 吸取教训,下次不要掉进相同的坑里.</li></ol><h2 id="自尊">自尊</h2><p>自尊代表人对自我的评判和感受. 很多时候明明已经不错了,但还是经常感到痛苦和低自尊?这个悖论其实取决于你的自尊中三种不同层次所占的比例:</p><ol type="1"><li>Dependent self-esteem. 依赖型自尊是指需要别人赞扬,将别人的评价作为自尊的体现, 与他人比较来评估自己的能力. 这是part ofhuman nature, 只是或多或少而已. 高依赖型自尊的人很可能有完美主义倾向,总想在别人心目中留下完美印象.</li><li>Independent self-esteem. 独立型自尊是指根据自己的标准评价自己,与自己比较来寻求自身进步. 这也是鸡汤文最喜欢说的: 不用和别人比,和自己比就行了.</li><li>Unconditional self-esteem. 无条件自尊是指足够自信,不需要依赖他人或自己的评价, 既不和别人比, 也不和从前的自己比,对自己当下的状态十分满足, calmer. 是一种just to be, just to exist的感觉.这种超然的享受事务原始美的状态并非漠视他人的情感,相反会更同情怜悯他人.</li></ol><p>随着年龄增长, 第3种的比例会增加, 但是it takes time.</p><h2 id="reference">Reference</h2><p><ahref="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1kx411S7ZU">幸福课</a><br />Happier: Finding Pleasure, Meaning and Life's Ultimate Currency.中文名《幸福的方法》<br />Choose the Life You Want. 中文名《过你想过的生活》</p>]]></content>

FSM通常可以用5元组<spanclass="math inline">\((Q, \Sigma, T, q_0, F)\)</span>表示:Q表示有限的状态集合, <spanclass="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>表示有限的输入集合,T表示状态转移函数, <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>表示初始状态,F表示结束状态.</p><h2 id="deterministic-finite-automaton">Deterministic FiniteAutomaton</h2><p>如果不知道DFA, 那么在做诸如LC 8/65等题时, 面对浩如烟海的corner case,即使写出了代码, 想必也是一团乱麻.</p><p>以LC 65题为例, 给一个包含大小写英文字母/数字/+/-/.的字符串,判断其是否是一个有效的数字.</p><p>DFA的思路是: 开始是自动机处于初始状态, 之后顺序读取每个字符,根据当前状态和该字符的转移规则转移到下一个状态,读完整个字符串后如果自动机处于某个可接受状态, 则合法.如果读取过程中转移失败或者最终自动机处于非接受状态, 则非法.</p><p>第一步就是要枚举所有的可能状态,通常对于字符串匹配问题可以考虑用字符串的不同部分作为状态集合.例如本题中一个合法的字符串应当包含以下部分:</p><ul><li>符号位+/-: 如果存在, 其后必须跟着数字或小数点</li><li>整数部分: 若干0-9组成的串</li><li>小数点: 两侧至少有一侧是数字</li><li>小数部分: 与整数部分相同</li><li>指数部分: e/E, 符号位, 整数部分</li></ul><p>所以状态集合包括:</p><ol start="0" type="1"><li>初始状态<br /></li><li>符号位<br /></li><li>整数部分<br /></li><li>左侧有整数的小数点<br /></li><li>左侧无整数的小数点<br /></li><li>小数部分<br /></li><li>字符e/E<br /></li><li>指数部分符号位<br /></li><li>指数部分的整数部分</li></ol><p>小数点有些特殊, 其两侧至少一侧有数字才合法.通常来讲小数点可以转移到e或小数部分, 但是对于左侧没有整数的小数点,其右侧必须有数字, 不能转移到e, 只能转移到小数部分,否则违背了小数点的规则. 例如<code>.e1</code>就是非法的,<code>3.e1</code>就是合法的. 因此小数点的状态需要分为2类:左侧有整数以及左侧无整数. 那么为什么不按照小数点右侧有无数字来分类呢?我认为最大原因在于状态机是不能回退的, 即如果已经访问到了小数点右侧,那么无法结合其左侧状态进行下一步的转移.</p><p>假设右侧有数字的小数点为a, 右侧没有数字的小数点为b.例如对于初始状态的输入<code>.</code>,能否转移到a或b都是<strong>不确定的</strong>,因为此时无法判断小数点右侧是否有数字. 如果采用左侧的划分方式,转移则是确定的.</p><p>第二步需要找到初始状态0和可接受状态2/3/5/8.</p><p>最后需要根据合法字符串的格式定义转移规则, 并画出转移图: <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/3f282f79feeb47d799fcf0d02a5a4867.png"alt="状态转移图" /></p><p>为了写代码方便,通常用<code>unordered_map&lt;state, unordered_map&lt;cur, state&gt;&gt;</code>来表示状态转移表,只要将上述转移图翻译成代码即可.</p><p>除了算法题的应用, FSM与KMP算法和正则表达式都有着密切关联.</p><h2 id="refs">Refs</h2><p><a href="https://patterns.eecs.berkeley.edu/?page_id=470">FiniteState Machine</a></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>中途岛海战是第二次世界大战中太平洋战场的决定性战役，其地位堪比苏德战场的斯大林格勒战役以及中国战场的平安格勒战役。从小学至今看了无数的资料却仍然稀里糊涂，但愿这篇blog能解此心结。</p><h2 id="战役背景">战役背景</h2><p>1941年12月7日，日军偷袭位于夏威夷群岛的珍珠港，以极其微小的代价重创美军太平洋舰队。不过这次偷袭并未对美军造成致命打击，尤其是美军航空母舰依然完好无损。为了逼迫美国进行谈判，日本决定彻底摧毁太平洋舰队的航母。为了将航母从珍珠港引诱出来围歼，日军最终决定通过“围点打援”的战术在进攻中途岛的同时伏击并歼灭美军太平洋舰队，即所谓的MI行动。</p><h2 id="战前准备">战前准备</h2><p>日军方面：由于珊瑚海海战中祥凤号沉没，翔鹤号被重创，瑞鹤号也需要休整，因此日方将剩余航母划分为第一航空舰队（一航舰）和第二航空舰队（二航舰）。一航舰由日本海军最强的4艘航母组成：苍龙号（常规情况舰载机52架）、飞龙号（常规情况舰载机54架）、加贺号（常规情况舰载机63架）和赤城号（常规情况舰载机54架），此次进攻4艘航母共搭载248架飞机以及12架侦察机，一航舰包括第一航空战队（一航战）和第二航空战队（二航战），一航战包括加贺号和赤城号（旗舰），指挥官南云忠一中将；二航战包括苍龙号和飞龙号（旗舰），指挥官山口多闻少将。二航舰拥有2艘轻型航母隼鹰号和龙骧号。需要注意的是：此时的日军飞行员毫无疑问都是顶尖选手。</p><p>为了掩盖真实的战略意图，日军制定了极其复杂的攻击计划，并且联合舰队司令长官山本五十六要求路途全程保持无线电静默。一航舰的主要任务是：夺取中途岛，摧毁岛上的飞机和机场跑道等重要设施，为登陆部队扫清障碍；寻找并消灭美军航母。因此南云将一半的舰载机装备对舰武器（鱼雷），防止美军航母出现。二航舰负责占领北边的阿留申群岛作为佯攻，试图声东击西来分散美军注意力，行动代号AL（Aleutian）。</p><figure><imgsrc="https://weaponsandwarfare.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/midwaybattle.png"alt="1942: Japanese Options | Weapons and Warfare" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">1942: Japanese Options | Weapons andWarfare</figcaption></figure><p>美军方面：1942年5月，美军已经部分破译日军无线电密码（据说破译了80%以上），还通过经典的“AF缺乏淡水”钓鱼行为确认日军的作战意图，因此总司令尼米兹上将决定提前设伏，将美军航母部署到中途岛东北部，在日军攻击中途岛时发起偷袭。珊瑚海海战中列克星敦号航母（CV-2）沉没，约克城号（CV-5）被重创，但是美帝损管仅用了3天时间就将约克城号大致修复。美军3艘航母分为2个特混舰队：第16特混舰队包括企业号航母（CV-6）和大黄蜂号航母（CV-8），由斯普鲁恩斯少将指挥；第17特混舰队包括约克城号航母（旗舰），由弗莱彻少将指挥。5月28日，第16特混舰队率先离开珍珠港，5月30日第17特混舰队紧随其后，6月2日美军航母在东北部设伏完毕。</p><h2

aria-hidden="true">Battle of Midway, Movement

aria-hidden="true">IJN走位</figcaption></figure><p>0827，中途岛的最后一波11架老式俯冲轰炸机来袭，但很有自知之明地选择攻击战列舰榛名号而非航母编队，11架日机迎战，美机无一命中，损失2架。与此同时，一架美军潜艇鹦鹉螺号向日军雾岛号战列舰发射鱼雷后被日舰发现，雾岛号躲过攻击，美军潜艇跑路，日军岚号驱逐舰离开舰队追击美军潜艇，“带路岚”最终返航时带着企业号的美军轰炸机（麦克拉斯基少校）找到了日军航母编队。</p><p>0837美军攻击结束，南云开始回收飞机。0910，友永机队全部降落。不过最迷惑的是这段时间南云的编队竟然朝着美军船队不断行进，而且日机比美机飞得远啊，为什么要主动靠近呢？接着，南云只需要等待45min放飞飞机攻击美军航母即可。0918，美军航母编队15架VT-8鱼雷轰炸机来袭，被零战锤爆，最终全部被击落，30名机组成员只有1人幸存，日舰没有受到任何伤害。0940，航母编队第二波14架VT-6来袭，此时停在甲板上的日机重新补给完毕，满弹满油，事实证明日军侦察机报告的距离有误，美军完全不用等到1015就可以打到日舰。美机9架被击落，日军损失1架零式。这2波攻击虽然没有造成伤害，但却拖延了日军放飞窗口。</p><p>1010，12架VT-3+6架野猫继续来袭，美机采用了著名的萨奇剪战术击落4架零战，仅损失1架野猫。美军的护航战斗机吸引了大部分零式，使得轰炸机可以抵近日军航母，在日军航母上空巡航的零式不断加入舰队东北方与美军VT-3和野猫的低空狗斗，造成日军航母上方防空力量空虚，这一波美机损失10架VT-3，日机损失7架零式。其实这一波又一波的饱和攻击并不是美军安排得当，恰恰相反是由于航母舰载机起飞管理混乱造成的结果，也算是因祸得福。</p><p>1020，50架美军俯冲轰炸机（好巧不巧，分别从企业号和约克城号起飞的2批编队飞了不同路线，并且约克城号的放飞晚了30min，竟然同时到达）几乎没有受到日军防空的零式拦截，这一波南云好运不在，加贺号被命中4发，并且引爆了飞行甲板上的满油满弹日机，苍龙号同样如此，赤城号被仅投的1枚炸弹（贝斯特少校）洞穿机库，引爆机库内未被妥善放置的炸弹，只有友永所在的飞龙幸存。1030，南云将旗舰换为轻巡洋舰长良号，日军此时已经注定失败了。山口多闻意识到自己的飞龙号是唯一的幸存者，开始组织反击。</p><p>1045，飞龙号的6架零式+18架俯冲轰炸机奔袭美军航母。1050，山本获悉战况，召回阿留申群岛的隼鹰号航母和龙骧号航母，以及其它佯攻力量救援南云，可惜远水解不了近渴，此时美军航母舰队向东行驶远离日军。1152，美军雷达侦测到日机编队，战斗机升空迎敌，重创日机编队。1210，日机剩余的轰炸机开始攻击约克城号，4分钟后约克城号瘫痪，日军13架轰炸机+5架零式被击落。山口多闻自信地认为已经干掉了约克城号，接下来就是1v2的局面了。</p><p>1331，日军第二波10架轰炸机+6架零式由友永带队，山口多闻要求再干掉一艘美军航母，这样就可以出现1v1的黄金局面了。1430，友永发现30海里外的一个航母编队，看起来完好无损，他认为是企业号或者大黄蜂号，但是美帝的氪金损管使得这艘还是苦命的约克城号😂，美军6架战斗机迎敌。王牌对王牌，萨奇击落友永，日机损失5架轰炸机+2架零式，美军损失4架战斗机，约克城号再次被重创，1500舰长命令弃船。约克城号很坚强地活到了第三天并差点被救活，可惜最终被日军潜艇I-168击沉，同时参与救援的哈曼号驱逐舰也被不幸击沉。</p><p>1545，剩余日机返回飞龙号，随后山口得知干掉的仍然是约克城号，随即命令飞龙号撤退，准备休息后发动白天的最后一波攻击。又一次迷惑操作，飞龙号一整个下午都在朝着美军编队行驶，可能是已经杀红眼了吧。此前1133由约克城号放飞的美军侦察机在1430返程途中发现飞龙号。1705，企业号+约克城号的24架飞机抵达飞龙号，由于日军没有雷达，13架疲惫不堪的巡逻日机直到美机抵近后才发现，4发入魂，15min后大黄蜂号的机队抵达发现飞龙正在沉没。</p><p>山本最后希望再赌一把，利用其它战舰在夜间和美军航母对决。由于南云被撤职，近藤信竹中将接替指挥，直到2330仍未发现美军航母，不久后全体撤退。6月5日0255，山本宣布取消MI计划。</p><h2 id="战果分析">战果分析</h2><p>日军损失：4艘航母，1艘巡洋舰（三隈号），250架✈</p><p>美军损失：1艘航母，1艘驱逐舰（哈曼号），144架✈</p><p>经此一战，大量的日军优秀飞行员、经验丰富的机械师被消耗殆尽，后期只能神风了，美军完全扭转了力量对比并开始在太平洋易守为攻，采取“跳岛战术”不断迫近日本本土。退一万步讲，即使日军勉强赢了中途岛，也几乎没有可能战胜美利坚，强大的工业制造能力背后蕴藏着巨大的战争潜力，后期战舰下饺子就是铁证，这绝非战争资源匮乏的日本可以匹敌的。</p><h2

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cs144.github.io/">Introduction to ComputerNetworking</a>是Stanford的网络课，据说lab质量很高，就把它作为转System后的第一个小系统吧！</p><h2 id="准备工作">准备工作</h2><p>Stanford大气！能让我们这些野鸡学校的同学接触到最顶级的教育资源，甚至开放了lab，也希望大伙不要把题解po到github上！</p><p>因此我做的是Fall 2021的版本，所有的starter code都在<ahref="https://github.com/CS144/sponge">这里</a>。</p><p>至于如何在自己的github上备份代码，参考<ahref="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10065526/github-how-to-make-a-fork-of-public-repository-private">这里</a>。</p><p>虚拟机平台用的是VirtualBox，144官方提供了基于Ubuntu的系统镜像，CPU和RAM随便设。</p><p>大致按照<ahref="https://stanford.edu/class/cs144/vm_howto/">官方文档</a>配置环境，windows环境可以用powershell，无需<ahref="https://putty.org/">Putty</a>。<br />开启虚拟机，通过sshclient建立TCP连接到远程主机的某端口：<code>ssh user@remote -p port</code>，<code>user</code>是在远程主机的用户名，<code>remote</code>是远程机器的地址（IP/域名），<code>port</code>是sshserver监听的端口，默认22（即登录请求会送进远程主机的22端口），上面通过-p参数改变了该端口。</p><p>不过遇到了点问题：<br /><img src="lab0-1.png" alt="putty error" /><br />奇怪！远程虚拟机明明安装了ssh服务!</p><p>从主机去ping虚拟机超时，但是虚拟机可以ping通主机，参考<ahref="https://www.cnblogs.com/mengjie88/p/11803879.html">这个设置</a>成功ping通，后来发现国内的这些blog都是在胡说八道，真正的原因和解决方案在<ahref="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/145997/trying-to-ssh-to-local-vm-ubuntu-with-putty">这里</a>，本质上是虚拟机的端口转发没设置好，设置好后VB会把连接localhost:2222的TCP请求转发到虚拟机的22号端口。</p><p>关于IDE，开始用的VIM，后来想用vscode，Host上安装vscode以及remote-ssh插件，关于配置网上一大堆教程，自行学习吧，powershell以后就负责编译运行了。</p><h2 id="lab-0">Lab 0</h2><h3 id="networking-by-hand">Networking by hand</h3><p>这些小游戏都是为了翻译翻译：什么是可靠的双向字节流，网络通过这种抽象完成许多重要的交互，如上网冲浪、发邮件等。</p><p>第一个事是要手动模拟浏览器的请求过程（注意手速，不然还没输完就408Timeout了）：</p><ol type="1"><li><code>telnet cs144.keithw.org http</code>：<code>telnet</code>作为一种client程序，负责和服务器的某个服务建立连接。用telnet客户端程序在本机和服务器之间开一个可靠的字节流，并请求服务器的http服务（80端口），连接成功证明端口可用</li><li>建立连接后就要通过HTTP协议请求内容：需要告诉服务器所请求URL的path和host：<code>GET /hello HTTP/1.1</code><code>Host: cs144.keithw.org</code>，不过为啥需要host呢？难道服务器不知道自己的ip吗，好像是因为服务器可以同时运行多个网站/服务</li><li><code>Connection: close</code>：表示希望服务器一旦完成响应，就关闭连接</li><li>输入回车（空行）：表示HTTP请求头结束，接下来是请求数据（当然GET没有，POST有）</li></ol><p>其实这就是一个HTTP请求报文，效果：<br /><img src="lab0-2.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />作业就是瞎玩：<br /><img src="lab0-3.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /></p><p>第二个事是学着发邮件，请求服务器的SMTP服务（主要用来发邮件），我试试和自己的邮箱互动下：<br /><img src="lab0-4.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />这里要注意：首先要开启IMAP/SMTP服务，还需要获取第三方客户端登录的授权码，登录时邮箱名称和授权码都需要Base64格式。</p><p>文档里说From地址是可以伪造的，有点神奇，垃圾邮件可能挺喜欢干这事！但是我实际操作时是伪造不了的：<br /><img src="lab0-5.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />因为已经登录了本人账户，所以发件人必须一致，Stanford那个没有登录，也许是商业邮件系统一般都比较完善？</p><p>第三个事是作为服务器去监听，主要使用所谓的瑞士军刀netcat：<br /><code>netcat -v -l -p 9090</code>：-v表示显示执行命令过程，-l表示开启监听，-p表示在指定端口监听<br /><code>telnet localhost 9090</code>：<br />然后服务器（netcat）和客户端（telnet）就可以通信啦！</p><h3 id="network-program-using-an-os-stream-socket">Network program usingan OS stream socket</h3><p>这部分让同志们利用操作系统内核提供的streamsocket从Internet上抓网页，和上文中手动抓差不多，不过这次是把手动过程写成代码。</p><p>由于Internet只能提供尽最大努力交付的数据报服务，因此这些数据报可能会：丢失、乱序、内容更改、重复，所以通常OS会把Internet的这种抽象转为可靠的双向字节流，以便应用层软件使用。OS一般使用socket来完成这种转变并向程序员提供接口，socket和文件描述符类似，一旦建立连接就能进行可靠的通信。后续会自己实现一个TCP去揣摩这种转变。</p><p>这个简单的web client程序有几个要注意的地方：</p><ol type="1"><li>由于<code>connection: close</code>，因此服务器只会处理一次http请求</li><li>服务器响应后就会关闭从server到client的socket连接，但是client的<code>socket.read()</code>可以持续读：Ifthe connection is broken on a stream socket, but data is available, thenthe read() function reads the data and gives no error. If the connectionis broken on a stream socket, but no data is available, then the read()function returns 0 bytes as EOF.</li><li>EOF一般是一个定义为-1的宏，因此没有对应的ASCII字符，因此也无法显示出来（可以强制转int），C语言将其定义在某个头文件的宏里（可以直接用EOF判断），C++一般使用函数判断。EOF的作用就是client可以判断是否读完了server发来的响应，终端输入windows环境是ctrl+Z，linux是ctrl+D</li><li>为什么一个<code>read()</code>不够呢？因为<code>read()</code>是有limit的，超过上限就得多次读，<code>std:string FileDescriptor::read(const size_t limit=std::numeric_limits&lt;size_t&gt;::max())</code></li><li>及时关掉socket的写功能是一个<ahref="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4160347/close-vs-shutdown-socket">好习惯</a></li></ol><figure><img src="lab0-6.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">在这里插入图片描述</figcaption></figure><h3 id="an-in-memory-reliable-byte-stream">An in-memory reliable bytestream</h3><p>在单机上实现一个可靠的字节流（内存里当然是可靠的），即接收方收到的字节流和发送方发出的字节流是完全一致的，writer可以结束字节流输入，reader读到EOF后就无法继续读。<br />基本可以理解为一个容量为<code>capacity</code>的buffer，<code>capacity</code>用来进行流量控制，文档说了只会进行单线程操作，因此不用担心并发的读/写。<br />需要注意：流本身可以无限长，<code>capacity</code>存储的是已经写入但还未读取的字节，哪怕<code>capacity = 1</code>，只要writer每次写入一个字节，reader读走，这个流就可以无限长。</p><p>开始想用<code>queue</code>，但是<code>queue</code>无法支持<code>peek_output</code>操作，那就用<code>deque</code>了。<br /><code>size_t write(const std::string &amp;data)</code>：如果长度大于<code>capacity</code>该如何处理？这种情况多余的写入只能被丢弃，就和网络上超出线路容量的写入被丢弃一样。<br /><code>size_t bytes_read() const</code>返回的是所有pop的字节数目，包括<code>read(const size_t len)</code>和<code>pop_output(const size_t len)</code>。<br /><code>bool input_ended() const</code>返回流输入是否结束；<code>bool eof() const</code>是reader判断是否读取到了流输出的结束位置，因此必须满足writer已经有过写入且buffer为空。</p><p>记得先<code>make format</code>，再<code>make</code>编译，最后<code>make check_lab0</code>自动化测试。</p><h2 id="lab-1">Lab 1</h2><p>接下来的4个lab要自行实现一个TCP，模块如下：<br /><img src="lab1-1.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />由于sender会将发送的字节流分割为若干segments，每段不超过1460B，封装为数据报交给网络传送，但这些segments可能会乱序、丢失、重复、交叉重叠、长度不一，但是不会出现inconsistent的段，因此Lab1要实现一个流重组器，将收到的字节流中的segments拼接还原为其原本正确的顺序。</p><p><code>StreamReassembler</code>会用一个可靠字节流<code>ByteStream</code>作为输出：assoon as the reassembler knows the next byte of the stream, it will writeit into the <code>ByteStream</code>.接着应用层就可以从<code>ByteStream</code>读取有序的字节流。<code>StreamReassembler</code>和<code>ByteStream</code>的容量大小是一样的，不过<code>ByteStream</code>真正的size（绿色部分）是动态变化的。</p><p><code>push_substring(const string &amp;data, const uint64_t index, const bool eof)</code>一旦超出<code>StreamReassembler</code>的容量，就只能丢弃该碎片（或者丢弃部分）；<br /><img src="lab1-2.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />根据上图：可以想象为我们拥有一条index从0开始的无限长的字节流，每个段都有自己在流中的位置，随着应用层读取流中的数据，<code>StreamReassembler</code>就像一个滑动的窗口，落在该窗口内的段都需要被按序组装。</p><p>显然，需要用某种数据结构把不能直接写入<code>ByteStream</code>中的segments存起来：<strong>data+index</strong>即可唯一确定，因此单个segment可以用类、结构体或<code>std::pair</code>存储，为了方便起见，在segment结构体中增加成员变量<code>len</code>来指示其有效长度。<br />由于可能需要根据index快速查找合并位置，因此最好按序存储，并且自动去重，所有不能写入的segments可以用<code>std::set</code>来存，底层基于红黑树实现。</p><p>处理逻辑：</p><ol type="1"><li>新来段是否超出/部分超出了<code>StreamReassembler</code>的窗宽，如超过则进行剪切；</li><li>新来段是否和<code>ByteStream</code>之前（蓝色+绿色部分）有重叠，如有则切除重叠部分；</li><li>合并新段和暂存段：确定新段插入位置，不断将其前后的暂存段往新段上合并，直到找不到可以继续合并的暂存段；</li><li>判断能否写入<code>ByteStream</code>；</li><li><strong>处理后</strong>新段的eof为true：<del>若暂存区为空，结束向<code>ByteStream</code>的写入</del>结束写入的时机可能会导致潜在bug，后面有血泪教训；若暂存区非空，<del>报错</del>，可能是lastsegment先到达但还不能写入，因此存入暂存区。</li></ol><p>根据上述逻辑准备用3个函数完成：</p><ol type="1"><li><code>void _cut_overlap(segment &amp;seg);</code>完成12</li><li><code>void _merge_segs(segment &amp;seg);</code>完成3</li><li><code>void _write_to_stream();</code>完成4</li><li>直接在<code>push_substring()</code>处理5</li></ol><p>这个实验一般就会开始出bug，我直接跪在了cornercase，来了一个eof为<code>true</code>的<code>""</code>，空串是要被忽略的，但是这个空串带了我们需要的eof信息，由于在<code>_cut_overlap</code>直接返回：<figure

/>因此核心问题在于什么时候调用<code>end_input()</code>，我用了<code>_eof_index</code>来指示结束的位置而非用布尔变量<code>_eof</code>，一旦<code>_first_unassembled &gt;= _eof_index</code>就结束输入。</p><h2 id="lab-2">Lab 2</h2><p>Lab2要实现<code>TCPReceiver</code>，将从Internet接收的segments送入<code>StreamReassembler</code>转为可靠的<code>ByteStream</code>，以供应用层从socket读取。<br />除此之外，<code>TCPReceiver</code>还要负责和sender反馈：1. firstunassembled字节的index，也叫做确认号<strong>acknowledgment</strong>，这样sender才知道下次该发送啥；2.first unassembled和first unacceptable之间的窗宽windowsize，用来告诉sender允许发送的字节范围。两者结合形成滑动窗口用来进行<strong>flowcontrol</strong>。</p><p>第一件必须要处理的事就是序列号sequencenumber的转换：在<code>StreamReassembler</code>中我们用的是64位的streamindex，因此不太可能溢出，但是TCPheader空间宝贵，所以第一个字节的index采用32位的seqno，这样就带来几个问题：1.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>最近参加了一个<ahref="https://datafountain.cn/competitions/537/">AI比赛</a>，引起了我对机器学习以及自己未来职业方向的重新思索，我发现自己现在做决定更加在乎自身的兴趣而非舆论等其他因素，也算是一种进步了吧！</p><p>比赛的过程我很难享受编程带来的乐趣，只有在看到AUC指标提升零点几个百分点时才会有一丝丝成就感，而在数据清洗、特征构建、魔改模型以及无脑调参这种占据算法工程师大量时间的环节感受到的只有繁琐和无聊，这不禁让我反思自己半年前的选择：如果将来步入互联网，到底是选择算法岗还是开发岗呢？</p><p>从世俗的角度来看，算法岗毫无疑问有着更高的薪资甚至更光明的前途，我也坚信机器学习会持续改变人类生活并且在未来应用到方方面面，但是需要多久时间可能谁也说不准。</p><p>从现阶段来看，AI的发展尤其是落地遇到了很多困难，突然想起了《智能计算》韩德强老师上课时指出的数据驱动的方法终究很难解释问题的本质，我当时嗤之以鼻，现在有些许赞同了。</p><p>从自身喜好来讲，对于不确定的东西我向来不太喜欢，然而机器学习领域充斥着大量的不确定性，大多数模型缺乏可解释性，我在操纵灰盒甚至黑盒的过程中祈求获得指标的提升，在出现bug时不好排查。除此之外，现实世界的数据大多数是杂乱繁琐的，需要花费80%以上的时间去清洗数据、构建特征，这也不是我喜欢做的事情。相对而言，我更加欣赏自己能做出来一个确定的、完整的系统呈现在眼前，它可以解决现实生活中的某个问题，并且可以重复使用（可复现），所以我决定学习重心重新回到开发岗位，当然如果时间充裕可以去算法岗实习看看再做最终的决定。</p><p>还有就是胡神的很多思考对我触动很深。</p><p>我想好啦，做system！当然我肯定会把当前分内的事情做好、该学的学懂！</p>]]></content>

p[j + 1] == *</code>，意味着可以选择匹配0次或1次a：如果0次，意味着放弃目前遇到的这个<code>*</code>，那么只能<code>i不变, j = j + 2</code>，j越界匹配结束返回False；如果1次，意味着<code>s[i]</code>匹配成功，那么可以继续使用目前的这个<code>*</code>匹配<code>s[i + 1], j不变</code>。直到将<code>s</code>的所有字符匹配完毕，时间复杂度<spanclass="math inline">\(O(2^n)\)</span>。</p><p>另外一个例子<code>s=aab,p=c*a*b</code>，从<code>(i,j)</code>开始，先来看看可能使得匹配成功的情形：</p><ul><li><p><code>p[j + 1] == *</code>：无论当前字符是否匹配都要继续，因为<code>*</code>可以匹配0次，保留了成功的可能。此时可以选择匹配0次/匹配1次，如果选择匹配0次，意味着抛弃目前的<code>*</code>转移到<code>(i,j+2)</code>；如果选择匹配1次，意味着当前字符必须匹配且转移到<code>(i+1,j)</code>。</p></li><li><p>如果<code>p[j + 1] != *</code>，那么当前字符必须匹配即<code>s[i] == p[j] || p[j] == .</code>，否则无法继续进行返回False。如果当前匹配，那么继续判断<code>(i+1,j+1)</code>。</p></li></ul><p>如果上述2种成功的条件均不满足，那么只能返回False。</p><p>终止条件则是：</p><ul><li><code>i &gt;= len(s) &amp;&amp; j &gt;= len(p)</code>意味着字符串的所有字符匹配整个模式，返回True</li><li><code>i is ok &amp;&amp; j &gt;= len(p)</code>意味着<code>s</code>中仍然存在未被匹配的字符但模式已经耗尽，返回False</li><li><code>i &gt;= len(s) &amp;&amp; j is ok</code>意味着<code>s</code>中所有字符均匹配完毕但是模式仍未耗尽，此时不能判断成功与否，需要继续递归。</li></ul><p>即递归函数<code>dfs(i,j)</code>返回<code>s[i:]</code>与<code>p[j:]</code>是否完全匹配，暴力做法存在着很多重复计算，因此用哈希表存储已经求得的结果提高效率。</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAA8mgxlov8">Top-DownMemoization - Leetcode 10</a>讲得比较透彻。</p><h2 id="同时运行n台电脑的最长时间">2141 同时运行N台电脑的最长时间</h2><p>有n台电脑和一个电池数组<code>batteries</code>，第i个电池可以让一台电脑运行<code>batteries[i]</code>分钟，求n台电脑同时运行多久。</p><p>我第一次看到的时候就想到了优先队列，时间最久即每次选n个最大的电池<code>a=[]</code>，然后可以支撑<code>min(a)</code>分钟，直到<code>batteries</code>中正数个数小于n停止。</p><p>但发现连样例都过不了，比如<code>n=2,batteries=[3,3,3]</code>，第一次选2个最大的支撑3min，<code>batteries=[0,0,3]</code>，无法同时继续，但答案是错的。贪心策略不太对，每次选最大的n个是对的，但是不一定要支撑<code>min(a)</code>分钟。</p><p>最后发现二分答案是反着思考的：虽然求的是最长时间，先假设n台电脑可以同时运行t分钟，一台电池最多能供电t分钟，所有电池的可供电时间总和为S= min(sum(batteries),t*len(batteries))，检查这些时间是否能给n台电脑供电S / t &gt;= n</p><p><ahref="https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/maximum-running-time-of-n-computers/solution/er-fen-da-an-de-checkhan-shu-de-si-kao-f-g8no/">这张图很形象</a>对于当前枚举的时间P，共有k台电脑。需要看电池能否填满该矩阵，同一行不能有相同颜色。</p><p>对于大于等于P的电池，只能利用P，让其一直供应一台电脑即可，即填充一列，剩余电量只能丢弃，因为该电池不能同时供应2台电脑。对于小于P的，让其供应一台电脑直到电量耗尽，注意这些小于P的电池不可能出现同时供应2台电脑的情况，对于小于P的电池，首先拿一个填充一列，当然填不满，接着拿第二个继续填充，如果该列满了就填下一列，以此类推，由于小于P的电池最多填充P-1行，因此不会出现相同颜色。（最极端的情况就是：某种颜色的电量为1，只能填1行，第二种颜色最多P-1行，因此下一列不会重复，如果第二种颜色可以填P行，那么下一列才会重复）。</p><p>假设共m个电池, 大于等于P的有a个, 小于P的有m-a个.由于大于等于P的只需要撑a台电脑,因此问题转变为小于P的m-a个电池能否撑n-a台, 即sum(m-a) &gt;= (n-a) * P.稍微转化下: sum(m-a) + a * P &gt;= n * P.</p><p>因此判断P是否合法只需要求所有电池里：如果电量大于等于P，sum +=P，否则将剩余所有的电量小于P的电量全部加到sum起来，判断sum是否大于等于P* K。</p><p>二分法一般的题目就是求最大的最小或最小的最大，假设要求的是ans，那么从ans=0开始判断是否满足要求，然后判断ans=1,2,...直到上界。例如本题就是求最小里面的最大，比如0,1,2,...都满足要求，需要在其中挑一个最大的。</p><h2 id="section">767</h2><p>给定字符串，重排其中的字符使得任意两个相邻位置的字母不同。样例：s="aab"，输出"aba"最开始的想法是贪心+双指针，指针i从前向后遍历，指针j从i+1开始，如果s[i]==s[j]，j不断向后遍历找到第一个与s[i]不同的字母s[k]，将s[k]与s[j]交换。WA在了"baaba"，期待"ababa"，输出""，所以这种贪心策略显然是错的。</p><p>接着就想到需要考虑字符的出现频率，先按频率高低排序再去按照上述贪心，WA在了"aabbcc"，期待"abacbc"，输出""，很显然这种贪心策略本身就是错的。</p><p>接着就想到先安排出现次数最多的，如果当前要安排的与前一个字符相同，就选择出现次数第二多的，这样交替下去，可以写出如下代码：<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">class Solution:</span><br><span class="line">    def reorganizeString(self, s: str) -&gt;

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>深度神经网络的训练过程主要通过求解一个特定的优化问题来实现，然而由于该问题是一个复杂的高维非线性优化问题，并且不同的网络结构差异很大，不能将传统的优化方法直接使用。即使数据集和网络结构完全相同，不同的优化算法也可能导致完全不同的收敛效果。实际应用的一些简单方法虽然行之有效，但现有理论无法充分解释其有效性，超参数的不断增加也给优化增加了不少难度。如何确保算法收敛、如何尽快收敛以及能否收敛到全局最优一直是困扰学术界和工业界的问题。如果能够用优化理论去解释神经网络的训练行为，对于深度学习的推广应用将会起到巨大的推动作用。</p><p>对于有监督学习，给定包含n个样本的训练集<spanclass="math inline">\(\{(\mathbf{x}_1, y_1), \ldots, (\mathbf{x}_n,y_n)\}\)</span>，<spanclass="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>表示样本的特征向量，<spanclass="math inline">\(y\)</span>表示该样本对应的标签。我们的任务是利用样本信息来预测相应的标签，使预测值尽可能接近真实标签。如果用深度学习来完成这个任务，就需要通过调整神经网络的参数（权重W和偏差b）来近似数据背后的函数映射关系，这个关系往往是高度非线性的，网络越深表达能力也就越强，逼近效果的精度也就更高，因此网络结构很可能是极其复杂的。</p><p>为了衡量预测值和真实值之间的接近程度，通常需要采用某种距离度量方式<spanclass="math inline">\(l\)</span>，<spanclass="math inline">\(l\)</span>一般设计为<strong>可微</strong>的，接着用一些优化算法去最小化该目标函数。因此优化问题变为寻找最佳的参数使得<spanclass="math inline">\(l\)</span>最小，在不考虑正则项的情况下有： <spanclass="math display">\[\mathop{\mathrm{min}}_f \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n l(f(\mathbf{x}_i), y_i)\]</span> <spanclass="math inline">\(f\)</span>就是我们从输入到输出的映射函数，<spanclass="math inline">\(l\)</span>通常也叫损失函数，衡量预测值<spanclass="math inline">\(f(x_i)\)</span>和真实标签<spanclass="math inline">\(y_i\)</span>的差距，比如回归问题中经常使用的平方损失函数<spanclass="math inline">\(l=||f(x_i)-y_i||^2\)</span>。</p><p>需要注意的是：深度学习中的优化问题与传统意义上的优化问题有所差别。传统的优化问题需要尽可能找到目标函数的最值，而深度学习的最终目的是为了<strong>预测未知</strong>的数据，而不是将训练数据上的损失降到最低。我们定义的损失函数<spanclass="math inline">\(J(\Theta)\)</span>衡量的是当前模型参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span>在<strong>训练集</strong>上的优劣，然而，最小化训练误差并不意味着模型的泛化误差也会最小，为了降低泛化误差我们还需要关注过拟合问题，因此损失函数往往要加上<strong>正则项</strong>。统计学上称为经验风险最小化，即由于无法获得全部数据，所以只能用经验风险作为实际风险的近似。非常有意思的是：尽管大多数神经网络都是严重过参数化的，但是反而有着比较不错的泛化能力，这与传统的机器学习观点是矛盾的，泛化理论也需要更加深入的研究。</p><p>深度学习中的<spanclass="math inline">\(f\)</span>通常是多层的复合函数，由于太复杂而无法求出解析解，所以要用数值优化算法去求解。实际中主流的深度学习优化算法都利用梯度下降来求解，梯度下降是深度学习优化算法的基础，尽管目前已经很少直接使用，但它却是其他高级优化算法的基石：假设网络的参数为<spanclass="math inline">\(x=(x_1,x_2,...,x_d)^T\)</span>，优化的目标函数为<spanclass="math inline">\(f\)</span>，那么<spanclass="math inline">\(f\)</span>的梯度为： <span class="math display">\[\nabla f(\mathbf{x}) = \bigg[\frac{\partial f(\mathbf{x})}{\partialx_1}, \frac{\partial f(\mathbf{x})}{\partial x_2}, \ldots,\frac{\partial f(\mathbf{x})}{\partial x_d}\bigg]^\top\]</span>每个元素对应着目标函数在该方向上的变化率，因此只要沿着梯度的反方向就可以使目标函数减小得最快：<spanclass="math inline">\(\mathbf{x} \leftarrow \mathbf{x} - \eta \nablaf(\mathbf{x})\)</span>，<spanclass="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>是一个被称为学习率的超参数，用来控制每一步的大小。<spanclass="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>过小，收敛过程极度缓慢；<spanclass="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>过大，可能造成损失函数在最小点附近波动甚至发散。学习率的调整是神经网络训练过程中一个重要的调整参数，常常使人头痛不已，因此也出现了很多学习率自适应调整的算法，将在下面深入分析这些算法的优劣。</p><p>有了优化模型及最基础的求解方法后，我们需要对其性质和优缺点进行分析，以便于后续的改进。深度学习的优化问题大多是非凸的，因此存在很多挑战：</p><ol type="1"><li>局部最优：对于凸优化问题，局部最优即是全局最优。然而对于非凸问题，当损失函数到达局部最优点时，<spanclass="math inline">\(J(\Theta)\)</span>的梯度为0，<spanclass="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span>无法继续更新，损失函数无法继续下降；</li><li>鞍点：该点既不是局部最小也不是全局最小，但是该点的梯度消失，无法继续更新；</li><li>梯度消失/爆炸：由于初始值和激活函数选择不当(如sigmoid)，当梯度反向回传时，可能在某一层求导后梯度值很小/很大，导致训练速度极其缓慢。因此初始值的选择通常采用很小的随机数，避免收敛到比较差的区域，激活函数通常也会选择ReLU，避免梯度消失问题。</li></ol><p>局部最小和鞍点示意图如下： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210710191530881.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" />尤其在高维空间中，鞍点的问题变得更加严重：假设<spanclass="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span>是一个k维向量，<spanclass="math inline">\(J(\Theta)\)</span>的海森矩阵就有k个特征值，其梯度为0的点有可能是局部最小（特征值均为正）、局部最大（特征值均为负）或者是鞍点（特征值有正有负）。高维空间中特征值有正有负的概率很大，因此鞍点出现的可能性远大于局部最优点出现的可能性，并且鞍点周围的平坦区域可能很大，需要增加噪声扰动来逃离鞍点。</p><p>由于上述问题的存在，通常很难找到<spanclass="math inline">\(J(\Theta)\)</span>的全局最优解，但实际上为了减少过拟合的风险我们并不需要训练集上的全局最优，经典的梯度下降就可以带来足够的局部最优。</p><p>分析完优化模型本身的问题，再来看看最基础的GD的问题：目标函数通常是训练集中所有样本的损失的平均值，故目标函数的梯度为：<span class="math display">\[\nabla f(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n \nabla f_i(\mathbf{x})\]</span> 如果用Full-batchGD，那么每次迭代每个参数的梯度计算的时间复杂度为<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span>，对于大规模数据，这样的更新速度显然无法令人忍受。</p><p>学习率的选择是一项重要的调参工作，因此学习率的自适应变化就成为了研究热点之一，一些二阶方法应运而生，我们首先来看看牛顿法该如何解决这个问题。</p><p>对于损失函数<spanclass="math inline">\(f\)</span>，利用泰勒展开式有： <spanclass="math display">\[f(\mathbf{x} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}) = f(\mathbf{x}) +\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^\top \nabla f(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^\top \nabla^2 f(\mathbf{x}) \boldsymbol{\epsilon}+ \mathcal{O}(\|\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\|^3)\]</span> 式中的<span class="math inline">\(\nabla^2f(\mathbf{x})\)</span>即<spanclass="math inline">\(d*d\)</span>海森矩阵，存储了函数的二阶偏导数。为了求得<spanclass="math inline">\(f\)</span>的最小值，令上式对<spanclass="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>求导得0，有：<spanclass="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}=-\nablaf(\mathbf{x})H^{-1}\)</span>，即每次的参数更新为<spanclass="math inline">\(\mathbf{x} \leftarrow \mathbf{x} - \nablaf(\mathbf{x})H^{-1}\)</span>。二阶近似利用了损失函数的曲率信息，即如果曲率比较小，那么这步更新就会比较大，反之则更新较小。这里没有了学习率，而是通过“梯度的梯度”自动调整步幅，看起来比一阶的梯度下降要好一些。</p><p>然而深度学习的参数空间往往十分巨大，因此存储和计算海森矩阵的逆是不现实的，这也是牛顿法无法在DNN中使用的重要原因。为了缓解这个问题，学术界提出了一些拟牛顿法如L-BFGS等试图去降低存储消耗，但是计算代价仍然很高。</p><p>从以上的分析可以看到：无论是Full-batchGD还是牛顿法，都存在计算消耗大等问题，不适用于深度学习任务的大规模数据集训练，因此已经很少被直接用在深度学习模型中。为了处理这些问题，学术界提出了很多替代的优化算法，因此接下来我将调研分析当前常用的深度学习优化算法(SGD/Adam...)的优缺点，并结合实例及前沿研究进行相关讨论。 ## PopularAlgorithms优化算法在神经网络的训练中有着举足轻重的作用，选择合适的优化算法可以使得损失函数收敛地更快，同时收敛到更好的区域。目前比较流行的算法有下面几种：### 1 SGD尝试用mini-batch的梯度平均值作为整体梯度的无偏估计，参数的更新非常简单，沿着梯度的反方向即是loss下降最快的方向：<span class="math display">\[x_{t+1}=x_t-\alpha\nabla f(x_t)\]</span> 如果是BatchGD并且学习率足够小时可以保证损失函数单调不增。实际使用时一般会采用学习率递减策略保证模型收敛。</p><p>实现也非常简单：</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">x -= lr * grads</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>SGD存在几个问题：</p><p>首先，如果loss对于不同参数的敏感程度不同，那么收敛过程会在敏感参数方向上抖动：<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210710192205509.png" />对于非常大的参数空间，可能会收敛到不同的区域。其次，如果loss函数有局部最优或者鞍点，这些点上梯度为0，无法收敛到全局最优；最后，如果采用mini-batch，那么计算出的梯度值是有噪声的，意味着收敛过程可能会是非常曲折的，也即需要更多时间。### 2 SGD+Momentum为了解决SGD的问题，有学者提出了带有动量的SGD，其思想也很简单：更新参数时不仅考虑当前的梯度方向，还要考虑历史累积梯度方向，如果两者方向一致，那么这一步更新幅度就会增大；如果不一致，就会减弱沿当前梯度的下降幅度。<span class="math display">\[v_{t+1}=\rho v_t+\nabla f(x_t) \\x_{t+1}=x_t-\alpha v_{t+1}\]</span> <spanclass="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>可以看作是对历史梯度的衰减，一般取0.9。</p><p>带有动量的SGD实现： <figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">v = rho * v + grads</span><br><span class="line">x -= lr * v</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure> 这样就解决了SGD的三个问题：首先，由于历史梯度的存在，朝敏感方向步进的数量就会减少，会更加平滑的向最优点前进，减小了震荡，加速收敛；其次，对于局部最优点，虽然当前梯度为0，但是依靠历史梯度可以越过该点继续下降；最后，梯度噪声引起的震荡可以通过历史梯度互相抵消。 ### 3 NesterovMomentum NesterovMomentum由SGD+Momentum衍生而来，SGD+Momentum是将当前点的梯度和速度结合起来，而NesterovMomentum则是将当前点的速度和下一个近似点的梯度结合起来，意味着我们不是在当前位置去看未来，而是多看了一步，在稍远一些的下一步看未来，可以提前调整步进大小：<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210710192712932.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> 所以Nesterov Momentum的更新规则为： <spanclass="math display">\[v_{t+1}=\rho v_t-\alpha\nabla f(x_t+\rho v_t) \\x_{t+1}=x_t+v_{t+1}\]</span> 通常我们希望针对<spanclass="math inline">\(x_t\)</span>计算梯度，通过简单的变量替换，得到新的更新规则：<span class="math display">\[v_{t+1}=\rho v_t-\alpha\nabla f(x_t) \\x_{t+1}=x_t+v_{t+1}+\rho(v_{t+1}-v_t)\]</span> Nesterov的实现： <figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">v_prev = v</span><br><span class="line">v = rho * v - lr * grads</span><br><span class="line">x += (1 + rho) * v - rho * v_prev</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure> ### 4 AdaGrad前面的几种方法都是设置了一个全局的学习率，AdaGrad则通过引入二阶动量使得学习率可以针对<strong>每个参数</strong>自适应地取值：对于更新频繁的参数，已经有了很多认知，不希望因为单个样本影响太大，所以学习率可以小一些；对于更新稀疏的参数，希望从偶尔出现的能更新该参数的样本中多获得一些信息，所以学习率可以设置地大一些。为了了解参数更新的频繁程度，引入二阶动量——每个维度上历史梯度值的平方和：<span class="math display">\[grad\_squared +=\nabla^2 f(x_t) \\x_{t+1}=x_t-\cfrac{\alpha\nabla f(x_t)}{\sqrt{grad\_squared+10^{-7}}}\]</span> 此时的学习率实质上是<spanclass="math inline">\(\cfrac{\alpha}{\sqrt{grad\_squared}}\)</span>，为了避免除0，一般分母加上一个很小的平滑项。如果某个参数更新频繁，那么grad_squared就会增大，学习率也就越小。</p><p>AdaGrad的实现： <figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">grad_sq += grads**2</span><br><span class="line">x -= lr * grads / (numpy.sqrt(grad_sq) + eps)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>AdaGrad的问题在于随着grad_squared单调递增，学习率最终会单调衰减到0，意味着很可能会提早终止训练过程。### 5 RMSProp/AdaDelta为了缓解AdaGrad的学习率变化过于激进的问题，二阶动量的计算不累积全部的历史梯度，只关注过去某段时间内的梯度变化，用指数移动平均值来表示过去某时间段的二阶动量的均值：<span class="math display">\[grad\_squared=decay\_rate*grad\_squared+(1-decay\_rate)\nabla^2 f(x_t)\\x_{t+1}=x_t-\cfrac{\alpha\nabla f(x_t)}{\sqrt{grad\_squared+10^{-7}}}\]</span> decay_rate是一个超参数，一般取值0.9。</p><p>RMSProp的实现： <figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">grad_sq = decay * grad_sq + (1 - decay) * grads**2</span><br><span class="line">x -= lr * grads / (numpy.sqrt(grad_sq) + eps)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>因此，RMSProp仍然是通过梯度的大小来调整每个参数的学习率，不过现在学习率不会单调递减。</p><h3 id="adam">6 Adam</h3><p>Adam的出现是集成了一阶动量思想和AdaGrad等的二阶动量思想，即AdaptiveMomentum： <span class="math display">\[m_{t+1}=\beta_1m_t+(1-\beta_1)\nabla f(x_t)\\V_{t+1}=\beta_2V_t+(1-\beta_2)\nabla^2 f(x_t)\\x_{t+1}=x_t-\cfrac{\alpha m_{t+1}}{\sqrt{V_{t+1}+10^{-7}}}\]</span>由于m和V初始化为0，所以开始的几次迭代会偏向取值0，为了弥补这一缺点，又引入了偏差纠正项，完整的Adam算法如下：<span class="math display">\[m=\beta_1m+(1-\beta_1)\nabla f(x_t)\\m_t=\cfrac{m}{1-\beta_1^t}\\V=\beta_2V+(1-\beta_2)\nabla^2 f(x_t)\\V_t=\cfrac{V}{1-\beta_2^t}\\x_{t}=x_{t-1}-\cfrac{\alpha m_{t}}{\sqrt{V_{t}+10^{-7}}}\]</span> Adam的实现： <figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">m = beta_1 * m + (1 - beta_1) * grads</span><br><span class="line">m_t = m / (1 - beta_1**t)</span><br><span class="line">v = beta_2 * v + (1 - beta_2) * grads**2</span><br><span class="line">v_t = v / (1 - beta_2**t)</span><br><span class="line">x -= lr * m_t / (numpy.sqrt(v_t) + eps)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>如果Adam再加上Nesterov的向后看一步的思想，就是Nadam算法。 ## Experiment为了对上述算法有更加直观的认识，同时在部分程度上比较不同算法的性能，构造一维函数<spanclass="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>作为损失函数，其表达式如下： <spanclass="math display">\[f(x)=0.01x^2+sin(x)+\frac{1}{3}cos(3x)+\frac{1}{5}sin(5x)+\frac{1}{7}cos(7x)\]</span> 这个损失函数含有大量的局部最小点以及悬崖，如图所示： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2021071019313296.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" />为了公平起见，比较时将x的初始值设为-29，每种算法的迭代次数均设置为300次，学习率均设置为0.1，迭代过程如下图所示：<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210710193206336.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> 最终的收敛结果如下表所示： | 算法 | 最终x |最终损失 | | -------- | ------ | -------- | | SGD | -27.98 | 7.19 | |Momentum | -24.00 | 6.21 | | Nesterov | -24.00 | 6.21 | | AdaGrad |-27.98 | 7.19 | | RMSProp | -28.95 | 9.10 | | Adam | -26.46 | 5.59 |</p><p>从上图和上表可以看到：Adam算法在前期收敛很快，并且最终效果最好，是综合性能最佳的算法；带动量的SGD能够越过一些局部极小值，在没有精细调参的情况下一度达到了和Adam类似的效果；AdaGrad开始时的梯度很大，但是由于学习率过早地减小，最终效果并不出众；这些结果进一步佐证了之前对各种算法的分析。</p><p>如果将学习率设置为0.01，对比如下： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210710193256448.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" />可以看到：精调后的Momentum、Nesterov和Adam的效果几乎不相上下，这只是初步调整了学习率参数，如果通过验证集更加精细地调整超参数的值，那么SGD+Momentum完全可以达到甚至超越Adam的表现，当然这也需要人为付出更多的努力，Adam这个烦恼则小得多。</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td

<imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210306203509952.gif#pic_center"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2021030620351970.gif#pic_center"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> ## ResearchAdam虽然是集大成者，而且也被推荐为起始的默认优化算法，但是一些Paper揭示了Adam的一些问题。### 1 过拟合 Berkeley在NIPS2017的一篇文章指出：如果一个问题有多个全局极优，即使从相同的初始值出发，不同的优化算法也会得到完全不同的结果。文章构造了一个简单的线性可分的二分类问题，证明了SGD在这种情况下测试误差为0，而AdaGrad等自适应方法会把所有的测试样例分为正类，泛化能力极差，也就是根本不能工作。</p><p>随后作者又用VGG+BN+Dropout的网络结构在CIFAR-10数据集上进行了实验：<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210710193712619.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" />可以看到：前期训练中Adam有优势，但SGD的泛化能力确实比Adam要好。</p><p>最后，为了彻底黑化Adam，文章又用了文本数据集和一些NLP模型做了实验：<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210710193823396.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" />即便有时候自适应方法的训练loss会更低，但SGD的泛化能力都无一例外地胜过了自适应的方法。自适应方法在训练初期速度很快，但是后期表现平平。</p><p>泛化能力差的原因在于：自适应方法倾向于关注稀疏的特征，因为这些特征对于训练样例的鉴别是很有效的，尤其在训练样例数少而特征较多的数据集中，但是这些特征其实并非关键特征，这样自适应学习率算法出现过拟合的风险就会增大，导致泛化能力不佳，最终的收敛效果不如传统的SGD。### 2 二阶动量波动Google的一篇文章从数学上证明了在某些特定情况下Adam可能不收敛，因为二阶动量取的是某个时间窗口的变化，所以<spanclass="math inline">\(V_t\)</span>的变化可能会剧烈震荡，尤其在高维情况下，梯度的方差可能随时间波动很大，导致学习率震荡，模型无法收敛。这也是为什么一般<spanclass="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span>要取0.999这么大的值，避免二阶动量有太大波动。</p><p>一般认为Adam默认的<span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>和<spanclass="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span>不需要调整，采用默认的0.9和0.999即可。但是这两个超参如果不按这样设置，Adam可能永远不会收敛到最优值。文章从数学上证明了对任意的<spanclass="math inline">\(\beta_1,\beta_2\in[0,1),\beta_1&lt;\sqrt{\beta_2}\)</span>，都存在一个随机的凸优化问题使得Adam不能收敛到最优解。</p><p>为了避免二阶动量的剧烈震荡，文章对其进行了控制，提出了一个新算法AMSGrad确保模型收敛，<spanclass="math inline">\(V_t=max(V_{t-1},\beta_2V_{t-1}+(1-\beta_2)\nabla^2f(x_t))\)</span>。</p><p>作者随后通过人造数据和真实数据进行了实验：</p><p>人造数据上的结果： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210710193934596.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" />很显然在Adam没有找到最优解的这些数据上，改进后的算法都表现良好。</p><p>在MNIST上的效果： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210710193956571.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" />这篇文章最终获得了2018年ICLR最佳论文，但是引起了很大争议。主要原因在于其构造的令Adam失效的数据在实际情况中出现的概率极低，即使出现也会在数据预处理时被筛掉，因此并没有特别广泛的实际用处。另外，文章过于强调训练集上的损失函数值，甚至有人通过复现表明文章提出的AMSGrad算法在测试数据上表现很差，与原文中的某些结论相互矛盾。### 3 学习率下降arXiv上的一篇文章通过在CIFAR-10上的实验证明Adam在一些情况下虽然速度快，但收敛效果没有SGD好：<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210710194231292.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" />文章通过实验发现主要原因在于后期Adam的学习率过低，影响了最终效果。文章尝试通过控制学习率下界，提高了最终收敛效果。</p><p>既然Adam后期有问题，那么一个自然的改进就是前期训练使用Adam，用来快速减小loss；后期训练转换为SGD，用稍慢的速度寻找更佳的解甚至是最优解。但是这样也会引入新的问题：在什么时刻切换？切换为SGD后的学习率又该如何设置？</p><p>文章提出了SWATS(Switches from Adam toSGD)策略来解决上面2个问题，在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上实验效果看着还不错：<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210710194309531.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210710194329636.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" />这些文章都采用了一些比较极端的数据去探索Adam的不适情况，然而实际中遇到这些极端情况的概率并不大，因此Adam并不失为首选尝试。通过上面的讨论可以看到：SGD和Adam各有优劣，精调后的SGD一般最终会收敛到更好的效果；Adam在训练前期收敛速度快，在稀疏数据上表现更好，对超参不敏感，不需要十分精细的调参。</p><p>如果对优化算法不熟悉，可以先尝试SGD+NesterovMomentum或者Adam；如果对某个优化算法很精通，那么调参就会相对容易些。如果资源足够，也可以尝试L-BFGS等二阶优化方法。另外，选择之前要充分了解数据的性质，对于比较稀疏的数据可以优先尝试学习率自适应调整的算法。</p><h2

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="gradient-boosting-regression">Gradient Boosting Regression</h2><h2 id="gradient-boosting-classification">Gradient BoostingClassification</h2><h2 id="xgboost">XGBoost</h2><h2 id="决策树集成">决策树集成</h2><p>集成学习可以组合多个基学习器，产生更加优异的性能。将决策树（如CART）作为基学习器，结合每个基学习器的预测结果作为最终输出，就像<ahref="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/model.html">下图</a>这样：<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2021061621501811.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> 正式一些的表示： <spanclass="math display">\[\hat{y}_i = \sum_{k=1}^K f_k(x_i), f_k \in\mathcal{F}\]</span> 其中，<spanclass="math inline">\(K\)</span>是决策树个数，<spanclass="math inline">\(f_k(x_i)\)</span>表示第<spanclass="math inline">\(k\)</span>个决策树的预测值。</p><p>为了定量描述模型参数与训练数据的匹配程度，我们还要定义待优化的目标函数：<span class="math display">\[\text{obj}(\theta) = \sum_i^n l(y_i,\hat{y}_i) + \sum_{k=1}^K \Omega(f_k)\]</span> ## Boosting Decision Tree集成多棵树的方式可以是Bagging，也可以是Boosting。Boosting的motivation是用一棵新树不断拟合当前的集成模型与真实值的残差，拟合后将该树也加入模型中，即所谓的AdditiveTraining： <span class="math display">\[\hat{y}_i^{(0)} = 0\\\hat{y}_i^{(1)} = f_1(x_i) = \hat{y}_i^{(0)} + f_1(x_i)\\\hat{y}_i^{(2)} = f_1(x_i) + f_2(x_i)= \hat{y}_i^{(1)} + f_2(x_i)\\\dots\\\hat{y}_i^{(t)} = \sum_{k=1}^t f_k(x_i)= \hat{y}_i^{(t-1)} +f_t(x_i)\]</span> 好了，接下来的问题就是每次迭代时的那棵新树<spanclass="math inline">\(f_t\)</span>要怎么训练呢？一个直观的想法就是选择那棵令目标函数最小的树：<span class="math display">\[\text{obj}^{(t)} = \sum_{i=1}^n l(y_i,\hat{y}_i^{(t)}) + \sum_{i=1}^t\Omega(f_i) \\          = \sum_{i=1}^n l(y_i, \hat{y}_i^{(t-1)} + f_t(x_i)) +\Omega(f_t) + \mathrm{constant}\]</span>我们先选择MSE作为损失函数，看看会发生什么： <spanclass="math display">\[{obj}^{(t)} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -(\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)} + f_t(x_i)))^2 + \sum_{i=1}^t\Omega(f_i) \\          = \sum_{i=1}^n [2(\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)} - y_i)f_t(x_i) +f_t(x_i)^2] + \Omega(f_t) + \mathrm{constant}\]</span>虽然MSE的形式比较友好，但是如果选择其它损失函数就很难有上式那般人性了，吃得太饱的同学可以试试logisticloss： <span class="math display">\[L(\theta) = \sum_i[ y_i\ln(1+e^{-\hat{y}_i}) + (1-y_i)\ln (1+e^{\hat{y}_i})]\]</span>为了增强可扩展性、便于计算，一般采用损失函数的二阶泰勒展开去做一个近似：<span class="math display">\[\text{obj}^{(t)} = \sum_{i=1}^n [l(y_i,\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}) + g_i f_t(x_i) + \frac{1}{2} h_i f_t^2(x_i)] +\Omega(f_t) + \mathrm{constant}\]</span> 其中，<spanclass="math inline">\(g_i = \partial_{\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}} l(y_i,\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}),h_i = \partial_{\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}}^2 l(y_i,\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)})\)</span>。 扔掉所有常数项，就得到了第<spanclass="math inline">\(t\)</span>步的目标函数： <spanclass="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^n [g_i f_t(x_i) + \frac{1}{2} h_if_t^2(x_i)] + \Omega(f_t)\]</span></p><p>弄完了training loss，接着还得研究下正则项<spanclass="math inline">\(\Omega(f_t)\)</span>，首先得给<spanclass="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>来一个正式点的定义： <spanclass="math display">\[f_t(x) = w_{q(x)}, w \in R^T, q:R^d\rightarrow\{1,2,\cdots,T\} .\]</span> 其中，<spanclass="math inline">\(w\)</span>是叶子结点的得分向量，<spanclass="math inline">\(q\)</span>是将样本点映射到对应叶子的函数，<spanclass="math inline">\(T\)</span>是叶子数目。如果有点抽象，就看看上图中的左子图吧：<spanclass="math inline">\(w=[2,-1],f(男孩)=w_{q(男孩)}=w_0=2\)</span>。</p><p>模型复杂度的具体定义随你了，XGBoost是这么定义的： <spanclass="math display">\[\Omega(f) = \gamma T + \frac{1}{2}\lambda\sum_{j=1}^T w_j^2\]</span> 就用上式重新写出我们第<spanclass="math inline">\(t\)</span>步的目标函数： <spanclass="math display">\[\text{obj}^{(t)} \approx \sum_{i=1}^n [g_iw_{q(x_i)} + \frac{1}{2} h_i w_{q(x_i)}^2] + \gamma T +\frac{1}{2}\lambda \sum_{j=1}^T w_j^2\\= \sum^T_{j=1} [(\sum_{i\in I_j} g_i) w_j + \frac{1}{2} (\sum_{i\in I_j}h_i + \lambda) w_j^2 ] + \gamma T\]</span> 其中，<spanclass="math inline">\(I_j = \{i|q(x_i)=j\}\)</span>表示第<spanclass="math inline">\(j\)</span>个叶子中样本点的索引集合，由于任意一个叶子中样本点得分相同，因此上式写成了对<spanclass="math inline">\(T\)</span>个叶子的求和。</p><p>令<span class="math inline">\(G_j = \sum_{i\in I_j}g_i\)</span>及<span class="math inline">\(H_j = \sum_{i\in I_j}h_i\)</span>，就有了一个相对简洁的表示： <spanclass="math display">\[\text{obj}^{(t)} = \sum^T_{j=1} [G_jw_j +\frac{1}{2} (H_j+\lambda) w_j^2] +\gamma T\]</span>因为叶子之间相互独立，所以令目标函数最优的得分向量<spanclass="math inline">\(w\)</span>为： <spanclass="math display">\[w_j^\ast = -\frac{G_j}{H_j+\lambda}\\\text{obj}^\ast = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^T \frac{G_j^2}{H_j+\lambda} +\gamma T\]</span> 目标函数<spanclass="math inline">\(obj^*\)</span>的值衡量着本次迭代树结构<spanclass="math inline">\(q(x)\)</span>对训练数据的拟合程度。</p><p>云里雾里一大堆，我都烦了，来看个例子： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2021061716123725.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> 假设在第<spanclass="math inline">\(t\)</span>次迭代选了这么一棵树，按照if-then规则将训练样本分到相应的叶子，将梯度信息相加得到每个叶子对应的<spanclass="math inline">\(G,H\)</span>，接着用<spanclass="math inline">\(obj^*\)</span>计算这棵树最小的损失，不行就换一种树结构，以求减小<spanclass="math inline">\(obj^*\)</span>。</p><p>忙活了大半天，终于知道了怎么度量一棵树的好坏。那么只要枚举所有可能的树结构，选那个令<spanclass="math inline">\(obj^*\)</span>最小的就好了。傻子都知道这是不行滴，所以只能贪心地一层一层地剥开你的心...哦不对，一层一层地优化：将结点分类为左孩子和右孩子的得分增益为：<span class="math display">\[Gain = \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{G_L^2}{H_L+\lambda}+\frac{G_R^2}{H_R+\lambda}-\frac{(G_L+G_R)^2}{H_L+H_R+\lambda}\right]- \gamma\]</span>其中，第一/二项分别表示左/右孩子的分数，第三项表示原始节点的分数，最后一项表示增加叶子的惩罚。可以看到：如果分裂后的得分增益小于<spanclass="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>，就不要继续分了，凑合过吧...</p><p>为了在每层获取到最佳的分裂点，通常先将训练数据排个序： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210617164041605.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> 暴力枚举一遍分裂点找最优就可以啦！</p><ul><li><span class="math inline">\(f_0(x)=0\)</span></li><li>对于第m棵树的训练：<ul><li>首先计算每条训练数据的残差：<spanclass="math inline">\(r_{mi}=y_i-f_{m-1}(x_i),i=1,2...,N\)</span></li><li>接着通过拟合上面得到的残差数据，训练出回归树<spanclass="math

DecisionTree每次迭代都将上一轮预测结果的残差作为当前的训练集，对于平方损失容易求得损失函数最小值的点，但是对于稍复杂的损失函数，残差的获得就只能通过负梯度<spanclass="math inline">\(\frac{\partialL(y_i,f(x_i))}{f(x_i)}\)</span>去逼近，这就是GBDT的核心思想。GBDT的训练与Boosting Decision Tree很相似：</p><ul><li>初始化弱学习器<span class="math inline">\(f_0(x)=\underset{c}{arg\min}\sum_{i=1}^{N}L(y_i,c)\)</span>，如果损失函数是MSE，那么<spanclass="math

type="1"><li>extrapolate问题<br />众所周知随机森林回归是不具备推理能力的，那么XGBoost可以吗？<br />答案是可以，因为梯度提升模型并不直接根据训练集的结果做预测，而是通过一系列树的加和得到，加和结果取决于每棵树的权重，权重则是由损失函数的一二阶梯度优化得来，并不依赖于训练集的上下限。</li><li>缺失值问题<br />GBDT/GBRT自身不支持缺失值的自动填充，例如使用sklearn中的GradientBoostingRegressor在训练数据包含缺失值时将无法训练，人工填充可能会引入偏差，但是XGBoost却可以自动地处理缺失值（但并不是填充）。<br />根据陈天奇大佬的说法：</li></ol><blockquote><p>Internally, XGBoost will automatically learn what is the bestdirection to go when a value is missing. Equivalently, this can beviewed as automatically "learn" what is the best imputation value formissing values based on reduction on training loss.</p></blockquote><p>那么究竟是如何自动学习最佳的分裂方向呢？<br />假设在结点A有50条训练样本，并且该结点只有一个可能的分割点：比如只有一个二元特征x，那么分割点就只有该特征取值为0或1，这样训练数据可以被分为3组：</p><ol type="1"><li>x取值为B的20条样例</li><li>x取值为C的20条样例</li><li>x缺失的10条样例，叫做M组</li></ol><p>那么M组的样例会被分别赋到B和C，接着计算<spanclass="math inline">\(\{(B,M),C\}\)</span>和<spanclass="math inline">\(\{B,(C,M)\}\)</span>的得分及损失函数衰减，两者中选择损失函数衰减大的。<br />如果使用MSE作为损失函数，并且B的标签均值为5，C的标签均值为10，M的标签均值为0。<br />如果使用<span class="math inline">\(\{(B,M),C\}\)</span>：<spanclass="math inline">\(\frac{|M|}{|B| + |M|}\text{mean}(M) +\frac{|B|}{|M|+|B|}\text{mean}(B) = \frac{10}{30}0 + \frac{20}{30}5 =3.\overline{3}\)</span><br />如果使用<span class="math inline">\(\{B,(C,M)\}\)</span>：<spanclass="math inline">\(\frac{|M|}{|C| + |M|}\text{mean}(M) +\frac{|C|}{|M|+|C|}\text{mean}(C) = \frac{10}{30}0 + \frac{20}{30}10 =6.\overline{3}\)</span><br />最后计算两者的MSE与划分前MSE的差，选择使得MSE下降更快的作为分裂方向（也就是得分gain更大的方向）。</p><p>在寻找最优特征分裂点（如年龄＜20还是年龄＜30）时，只访问该特征不含缺失值的训练样例，即如果年龄缺失，就不参与20和30的决策，这样计算复杂度也就降低了，尤其是对于稀疏数据。</p><p>预测时的缺失值有２种情况： 1.训练阶段已经见识过该缺失值了：按照训练时选定的方向往下走就行 2.训练阶段该特征没有缺失：默认走向右子树。</p><p>Ref里还有一个更加全面的例子，训练集有6个小孩，只有一个特征年龄（其中有2个样例年龄缺失），标签是身高，初始预测值为0.5，接下来每棵树都要拟合残差。</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Age</th><th>Height</th><th>Res</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>7</td><td>130</td><td>－129.5</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>9</td><td>148</td><td>－147.5</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>6</td><td>115</td><td>－114.5</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>15</td><td>164</td><td>－163.5</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>？</td><td>125</td><td>－124.5</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>？</td><td>140</td><td>－139.5</td></tr></tbody></table><p>接着要根据年龄特征寻找最优的分裂点，将年龄排序并选择中点（<strong>注意：这里就不考虑缺失值样例了</strong>），因此候选分裂点有6.5，8，12，对于每个候选点，分别计算将缺失样例划到左子树和右子树的Quality/SimilarityScore：</p><p><span class="math display">\[Quality\ Score=\frac{(\sum residuals)^2}{\#residuals + \lambda}\]</span></p><p>比如，对于分裂点6.5：<br />如果划到左子树： <span class="math display">\[Gain＝划分后的Quality\ Score－划分前的Quality\ Score \\＝\frac{(-114.5-124.5-139.5)^2}{3} + \frac{(-129.5-147.5-163.5)^2}{3} -\frac{(-129.5-147.5-114.5-163.5-124.5-139.5)^2}{6}=640.7\]</span><br />如果划到右子树：<span class="math inline">\(Gain＝划分后的Quality\Score－划分前的Quality\ Score＝580.8\)</span></p><p>接着对于8：1083；630.8<br />对于12：874.8；216<br />从中选择gain最大的（也就是使得损失函数最小的），分裂点选8，缺失值划到左子树。</p><h2 id="bug">Bug</h2><p><a href="https://www.lycecho.com/archives/2364">PYTHON XGBOOST 报错KEYERROR: ‘BASE_SCORE’</a></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p><ahref="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CC4N4z3GJc"><strong>GradientBoost</strong></a><br /><ahref="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/model.html">Introductionto Boosted Trees</a><br /><ahref="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/15305/how-does-xgboost-learn-what-are-the-inputs-for-missing-values">Missingvalues in XGBoost</a><br /><ahref="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/304962/is-is-possible-for-a-gradient-boosting-regression-to-predict-values-outside-of-t">Isis possible for a gradient boosting regression to predict values outsideof the range seen in its training data?</a><br /><ahref="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/77234/can-boosted-trees-predict-below-the-minimum-value-of-the-training-label">CanBoosted Trees predict below the minimum value of the traininglabel?</a><br /><ahref="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/1581#issuecomment-249853718">Whydoes XGBoost regression predict completely unseen values?</a><br /><ahref="https://medium.com/hypatai/how-xgboost-handles-sparsities-arising-from-of-missing-data-with-an-example-90ce8e4ba9ca">HowXGBoost Handles Sparsities Arising From of Missing Data?

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>上了十几年学，依然不会学习。不知是因为中学一些糟糕习惯的延续，还是当代知识难度的加深，我总是感受到日常学习的辛苦：身体累、脑子累、心也累。</p><p>刻苦的确是一种很好的品质，但这种品质有些时候未免有些夸大其词了。傻傻地机械地重复在中学时代那种应试环境或许可以带来一些成绩的提升，但是显然已经不适应现在的我。我尝试将每天安排得满满当当，恨不得每一分每一秒都在学习，然而效果却并不如人意。</p><p>除了智力等一些先天因素外，我个人觉得有以下几点问题：</p><ol type="1"><li>没有找到合适的学习方法，缺乏深度思考和知识体系。我总是试图单点单点地掌握未知的知识点，试图掌握每一处细节，甚至使用死记硬背的方式处理核心问题。笔记和博客也多是摘抄型，独立理解实现太少。</li><li>效率低下。尽管学习时长可能足够，但是且不说大多时间都在摸鱼，即使纯粹学习时间也经常犯困，无法专注完成手头的某项任务，总是过于频繁地切换，某段时间总想做好多件事。效率*时长=最终效果自然不会很好。</li><li>单打独斗。周围少有一起交流进步的伙伴，遇到问题只能单向地从互联网获取信息，没法通过讨论等形式取得快速进步。</li></ol><p>最近看了Marty Lobdell的一个演讲Study Less, Study Smart(<ahref="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0">YouTube</a>/<ahref="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Pz4y1f7oi">B站</a>)，有些启发，但是如何学习这种事是绝没有普适准则的，只能结合自身实际摸索总结。Marty还写了一本同名的书，内容比演讲稍微细化一些。</p><p>Marty认为比较重要的有：</p><ol type="1"><li>番茄工作法。每学习25~30min应该休息5min，可以听一首音乐、出去上个厕所、吃点喝点、回消息等等，这样再次回来后注意力和效率又会回升到一个较高的水平，而非效率指数级下降的持续长时间学习。完成一天的工作后，对自己进行更丰厚一些的奖励，比如看个电影、吃顿大餐等等，以形成正反馈。</li><li>寻找一个专门的学习地点，书桌是用来学习的，床是用来睡觉的。Intend tolearn rather than incidental learn.</li><li>费曼学习法。看完材料后，深加工以后尝试用自己的话复述给别人听，能准确复述或者能把别人讲懂才行。</li><li>对于学习材料要SQ4R(Survey, Question, Read, Record, Recite,Review)，要主动理解思考自己的笔记，产生更加深刻的认识，而非机械地摘抄背诵。</li><li>高质量睡眠、高质量运动。</li></ol><p>结合自身缺点和学科特点，我认为可以有以下改进措施：</p><ol type="1"><li>每学习一个新东西，理解算法流程、数学推导、实现细节等确实重要，但更重要的是领会方法的思想动机，掌握优缺点和应用场景，将其纳入知识体系中，也就是所谓的“解决现实问题的能力”。</li><li>合理安排学习计划，劳逸结合。不要安排得过于紧密，也不要过于松散。制定的目标不能模棱两可，要有可评估性，即某段时间里要扎扎实实做完TODOLIST上的某件事。</li><li>组队学习，提出自己的问题，解答别人的问题。</li><li>累了就休息，不要在低效率状态下学习工作。</li><li>科研，自学和生活尽量分离，一段时间只做一件事就不错了，不然会非常拧巴，非常累</li></ol>]]></content>

      <title>Dealing with Imbalanced Datasets</title>
      <link href="/posts/deal-imbalanced-data/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>The Imbalanced Datasets are very common in our life such as illegalusers or illness check. The machine learning model always performs badon these datasets if there are no specific dealings, especially theprediction accuracy of minority class. For example, if the data ishighly imbalanced such as 9995(negative):5(positive), then if your modeljust let every instance to be negative and you can get an acc of 99.95%but the result is meaningless. Another example is that misclassifyingthe minority is very severe. Assume that you misclassify the patient asnormal. Oh my god!</p><p>So researchers proposed two kinds of methods for this problem:</p><ul><li>Cost Sensitive Learning<br />When <strong>training</strong> your model, it will give differentclasses different weights in the <strong>loss function</strong> thus letthe model focus more on the minority class. In sklearn, there are<code>class_weight</code> and <code>sample_weight</code> for you. For<code>class_weight</code>, you can specify the weights for differentclasses such as <code>&#123;0:0.1,1:0.9&#125;</code> or you can set it to<code>balanced</code> then weights will be computed by <spanclass="math inline">\(\frac{\#samples}{\#classes\ *\np.bincount(y)}\)</span>. For <code>fit(sample_weight=)</code>, you give<strong>every instance</strong> different weights. When computing theloss for the instance, it will be <code>class_weight</code> *<code>sample_weight</code> * <code>loss</code>.</li><li>Sampling<br />Sampling means that we will change the original dataset rather thangiving them different weights.</li></ul><h2 id="sampling-methods">Sampling Methods</h2><p>Over-sampling means to increment the minority class.</p><ul><li>Random Over Sampling<br />To sample from minority class with replacement to let the number of eachclass is 1:1. Overfitting on minority class.</li><li>Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)<br /><span class="math display">\[x_{new}=x_i+\lambda(x_{zi}-x_i)\]</span> First you find the <code>k_neighbors</code> of <spanclass="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> in the minority class, then justselect one <span class="math inline">\(x_{zi}\)</span> randomly andproduce the new one. There are some variants such as borderline SMOTE,SVM SMOTE and KMeans SMOTE.</li><li>Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN)<br />The difference between SMOTE and ADASYN is that SMOTE will generate newsamples for random minority data until 1:1. But ADASYN willautomatically decide the number of new points generated for each <spanclass="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>. There will be more points generatedif there are more majority data around <spanclass="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>.</li></ul><p>Under-sampling means to decrease the majority class.</p><ul><li>RUS<br />Data waste.</li><li></li></ul><h2 id="example">Example</h2>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>We all know that Monte Carlo Simulation is used to estimate someunknown variables through random simulation. It is because that theprocess is too complicated so we cannot know the true rule behind it.Only god knows. But thankful to the randomness we can do lots ofexperiments to approach the truth.</p><p>MCTS has the same idea but it is based on a tree. Every path fromroot to leaf forms a solution and the whole tree defines the searchspace. It is a heuristic search strategy based on some loss functions.But it will follow not only the loss but also try to explore theunvisited nodes. So it's also trying to make a balance betweenexploration &amp; exploitation.</p><p>One iteration has 4 processes: Selection, Expansion, Simulation andBackpropagation. Let's start to build the tree. Initially the tree onlyhas a root node. Every node holds 3 info: action list for the nextdecision; visit times to measure the exploration; quality values tomeasure the exploitation.</p><ol type="1"><li>Selection<br />Using some criterion to select a child node which is eager to expand.There are 3 possibilities for the current state: If all the actions havebeen expanded thus the node has finished a complete search, then we willfind a child with max UCB value and go down the tree recursively; Elseif there are still some actions which have not been expanded (e.g. thenode has 20 possible actions but there are 19 child node in the tree),then it will select one action randomly from the unexpanded actions anddo Step 2 Expansion; Else game over and do Step 4 Backpropagation.</li><li>Expansion<br />We have found the most eager node N to expand and the action A afterSelection. So we need to add a new node S to the tree as N's child nodeby doing A.</li><li>Simulation/Playout<br />Start from S to let the game run randomly until game over. Then we get aperformance to be S's initial quality value.</li><li>Backpropagation<br />The nodes along the path from root to N will update their quality valuesafter S's simulation.</li></ol><p>After some fixed number of iterations or time limit, we will get alarge tree and select the best leaf node as the result. Below is afigure: <img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210404201349819.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /></p><h2 id="upper-confidence-bound-ucb">Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)</h2><p>When we need to select a child node to go down the tree, we usuallyuse UCB criterion: <spanclass="math display">\[\underset{child}{\operatorname{arg\max}}(\hat\mu_{child}+C\sqrt\frac{log\ n(s)}{n(child)})\]</span> <spanclass="math inline">\(\hat\mu_{child}\)</span> is the average rewardgathered over all tree-walks with prefix child, <spanclass="math inline">\(n(s)\)</span> the number of the parent's visitsand <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is constant controllingexploration &amp; exploitation.

Since the 2 actions are both unexpanded so we randomlyselect one (assume we select <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>).Then we add <span class="math inline">\(S_1\)</span> to the tree andplayout from <span class="math inline">\(S_1\)</span>.<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210519202838706.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />Assume we got a performance of 20. Next we need to backpropagate thevalue to <span class="math inline">\(S_1\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(S_0\)</span> and update Q and #visits.<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210519203559429.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />We finished the first iteration.</li><li>Second iteration<br />Start from <span class="math inline">\(S_0\)</span>, since <spanclass="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> has not been expanded so we have tochoose it. Then add <span class="math inline">\(S_2\)</span> to the treeand playout from here.<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2021051921175522.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />Then backpropagate to <span class="math inline">\(S_2\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(S_0\)</span>:<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210519212028325.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /></li><li>Third iteration<br />From <span class="math inline">\(S_0\)</span> there are no unexpandedactions so we need to select one child using UCB (assume C=2). <spanclass="math inline">\(UCB(S_1)=21.67,UCB(S_2)=11.67\)</span>. Thus weselect the leaf node <span class="math inline">\(S_1\)</span>.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>Hyper-parameters tuning has become an important work during trainingneural networks. As the number of Hyper-parameter is becoming larger,researchers proposed Grid Search &amp; Random Search to wish to getbetter combinations of Hyper-parameters. However, Grid Search has a hightime cost. Although some experiments showed that Random Search got abetter result than Grid Search but the result is still notfulfilling.</p><p>Besides, there are some gradient-based methods to solve the problem.But the objective function is usually not differentiable or even notcontinuous. Thus these methods have a very finite usage.</p><p>BO is a gradient-free optimization method to get global solutions ofa black-box function. The function usually has a high cost to computesuch as training a deep neural network after tuning theHyper-parameters. For this reason, we usually find a<strong>surrogate</strong> function to approximate the original function<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. In the field of AutoML, we oftenuse Gaussian Process, Random Forest or deep network as the surrogatemodel. The simplest form of BO is as follows: <img src="1.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>represents the black-box function that we want to optimize (black-boxmeans that the function transforms a configuration <spanclass="math inline">\(x\)</span> to an output but we don't know theexact function relationship). <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>represents the search space of the combination of hyper-parameters.<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> represents <strong>AcquisitionFunction</strong> which is used to select the promising <spanclass="math inline">\(x\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>represents the surrogate model which takes a configuration <spanclass="math inline">\(x\)</span> and outputs the performance (much like<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> does).</p><p>First we need to get some samples from <spanclass="math inline">\((f,\chi)\)</span>, thus we get <spanclass="math inline">\(D=(x_i,f(x_i)), i=1...n\)</span>.</p><p>Next we iterate <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> times (oftenfixed) to select configuration <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.Use the dataset <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> to train thesurrogate model <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> (much easier thantrain <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>). <spanclass="math inline">\(M\)</span> has several choices such as RandomForest, Tree Parzen Estimators. Here we use GP so we get theprobabilistic model <span class="math inline">\(p(y|x,D)\)</span>.</p><p>Then we need to find the most promising configuration <spanclass="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The most important thing forAcquisition Function is to make a balance between <strong>exploration&amp; exploitation</strong>. It means that when selecting the next <spanclass="math inline">\(x\)</span> we not only want to select thoseuntried points (exploration) but also want to select those tried pointswhich has a great <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>(exploitation).</p><p>Finally use the promising <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> toget corresponding performance <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span>and join the pair into <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>.</p><h2 id="gaussian-process">Gaussian Process</h2><p>If we assume <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> is independentwith each other, the Multivariant Gaussian Distribution's probabilitydensity is as follows: <span class="math display">\[p(x_1,...,x_n)=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{\frac{n}{2}}\sigma_1...\sigma_n}exp(-\frac{1}{2}[\frac{(x_1-\mu_1)^2}{\sigma_1^2}+...+\frac{(x_n-\mu_n)^2}{\sigma_n^2}])\]</span> We can rewrite the formula to the vectorized version: <spanclass="math display">\[p(x)=(2\pi)^{-\frac{n}{2}}|K|^{-\frac{1}{2}}exp[-\frac{1}{2}(x-\mu)^TK^{-1}(x-\mu)]\]</span> in which <span class="math display">\[K=\left[\begin{matrix}  \sigma_1^2     &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; 0      \\0      &amp; \sigma_2^2      &amp; \cdots &amp; 0      \\\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\0     &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; \sigma_n^2     \\\end{matrix}\right], x-\mu=[x_1-\mu_1,...,x_n-\mu_n]^T\]</span> Thus <span class="math inline">\(x\sim N(\mu,K)\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the mean vector and <spanclass="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the covariance matrix (a diagonalmatrix since the independence).</p><p>But what should we do when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> hasinfinite dimensions? Such as in a continuous temporal T or spatial S.Actually GP means Gaussian Distribution and Stochastic Process (abouttime T). GP is defined by an infinite number of Random Variables on acontinuous domain. In other words, it is an infinite dimension GaussianDistribution. Formally, let's sample n moments from T: <spanclass="math inline">\(t_1,...,t_n\in T\)</span>, thus we get an-dimensional vector <spanclass="math inline">\((\xi_1,...,\xi_n)\)</span>, if this vector is an-dimensional Gaussian Distribution then <spanclass="math inline">\({\xi_t}\)</span> is a GP.</p><p>Let's take an easy example to illustrate: suppose during peoples'life time, at every moment <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> theenergy of the population forms a Gaussian Distribution but differentmoments have different <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>: <img src="2.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> If we take 5 moments during a population'slife time, then <span class="math inline">\(\xi_1-\xi_5\)</span> allforms Gaussian Distribution but they have different <spanclass="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. If we sample an arbitrary moment<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> then <spanclass="math inline">\(\xi(t)\sim N(\mu_t,\sigma_t^2)\)</span>. If wesample at some points and connect them together we get two samples ofthe GP, as the figure shows.</p><p>Now that we know what happens at <spanclass="math inline">\(t\)</span>, let's consider the whole <spanclass="math inline">\(T\)</span>. We know that for a finite GaussianDistribution, it can be determined by a n-dimensional vector <spanclass="math inline">\(\mu_n\)</span> (reflects every Random Variable'sexpectation) and a <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix<span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> (reflects every RV'svariances and covariance between different dimensions). It is almost thesame for GP except that we cannot use a vector to describe every <spanclass="math inline">\(t\)</span>'s mean since it is infinite. So we needa function <span class="math inline">\(m(t)\)</span> to describe thecontinuous <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. For <spanclass="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> we should use a kernel function<span class="math inline">\(k(s,t)\)</span> to describe the covariancebetween time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(s\)</span>. Once <spanclass="math inline">\(m(t)\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(k(s,t)\)</span> is defined the GP is determined<span class="math inline">\(\xi_t\sim GP(m(t),k(s,t))\)</span>.</p><p>The most popular kernel function is RBF which is defined as follows:<spanclass="math display">\[k(s,t)=\sigma^2exp(-\frac{||s-t||^2}{2l^2})\]</span><span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(l\)</span> are two hyper-parameters. If <spanclass="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(t\)</span> are close in <spanclass="math inline">\(T\)</span> then the output covariance will belarger and it means the correlation between the two points isbigger.</p><p>Once we have some knowledge about GP we can start to know GaussianProcess Regression, which is a kind of Probabilistic Model. It meansthat we can use Prior and Observations to calculate Posterior. First wedefine a GP by <span class="math inline">\(m(t)\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(k(s,t)\)</span>, which is a Prior. Then we observesome data to revise the GP's <span class="math inline">\(m(t)\)</span>and <span class="math inline">\(k(s,t)\)</span> to get Posterior. Buthow?</p><p>Here we need to use some Gaussian Distribution's nice properties:Once Gaussian always Gaussian. It means that marginal distribution,summation and conditional distribution of a GD are still GD. Assume an-dimensional RV <span class="math inline">\(x\simN(\mu,\Sigma)\)</span> and we divide it into two parts <spanclass="math inline">\(x_A\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(x_B\)</span> then we get: <spanclass="math display">\[x=\begin{bmatrix} x_A\\ x_B\end{bmatrix},\mu=\begin{bmatrix} \mu_A\\ \mu_B\end{bmatrix},\Sigma=\begin{bmatrix} \Sigma_{AA}, \Sigma_{AB} \\\Sigma_{BA}, \Sigma_{BB} \end{bmatrix}\]</span> Then we can get: <spanclass="math display">\[x_A|x_B\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu_A+\Sigma_{AB}\Sigma_{BB}^{-1}(x_B-\mu_B),\Sigma_{AA}-\Sigma_{AB}\Sigma_{BB}^{-1}\Sigma_{BA})\]</span>Thus we could update the GD's Posterior parameters. It is much the samein GP. If we get some samples <span class="math inline">\((X,Y)\)</span>then the rest is <span class="math inline">\((X^*,f(X^*))\)</span>. Thejoint distribution forms an infinite GD: <spanclass="math display">\[\begin{bmatrix} Y\\ f(X^*) \end{bmatrix}\simN(\begin{bmatrix} \mu(X)\\ \mu(X^*) \end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}k(X,X), k(X,X^*) \\ k(X^*,X), k(X^*,X^*) \end{bmatrix})\]</span> So wewant to know the rest of the points based on the observed points: <spanclass="math inline">\(f(X^*)|Y\sim N(\mu^*,k^*)\)</span>. <spanclass="math display">\[\mu^*=\mu(X^*)+k(X^*,X)k(X,X)^{-1}(Y-\mu(X))\\k^*=k(X^*,X^*)-k(X^*,X)k(X,X)^{-1}k(X,X^*)\]</span> Here is an example:<img src="3.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> Finally let's return backto our BO's <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. We first assume ourprior: <span class="math inline">\(\mu(X)=0,k(X,X^*)=RBF\)</span>. Plusthe observed and evaluated <spanclass="math inline">\(D=\{x_i,y_i\}\)</span> we can get <spanclass="math inline">\(\hat \mu\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(\hat{\sigma}^{2}\)</span>, then the posteriorprediction is <span class="math inline">\(p(y|x,D)\)</span>, which isstill a Gaussian Distribution. The calculation process is as follows:<span class="math display">\[y=(y_1,...,y_i)^T \\\hat \mu=k^T(x)(k+\sigma_{n}^{2}I)^{-1}y \\\hat{\sigma}^{2}=k(x^*x)-k(x)^T(k+\sigma_{n}^{2}I)^{-1}k(x)\]</span> Once we get the posterior prediction <spanclass="math inline">\(p(y|x,D)\)</span>, we can feed them to theAcquisition Function to get next <spanclass="math inline">\(x_t\)</span>.</p><h2 id="acquisition-function">Acquisition Function</h2><p>There are some popular Acquisition Functions:</p><ol type="1"><li>Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) <spanclass="math inline">\(x_{t+1}=\underset{x\in X}{\operatorname{arg\max}}[\mu_{t}(x)+\beta_t^{1/2}\sigma_t(x)]\)</span> The weighted sum ofposterior mean and posterior standard deviation.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to make sure that every packet reaches its destination, weuse Retransmit. There are 3 approaches: Stop-and-Wait, Go Back N andSelective Repeat.</p><ul><li>Stop-and-Wait<br />Sender transmits packet one by one, label each with a sequence numberand sets timer after transmitting. If receive ACK, send next. If timergoes off, resend the previous packet.<br />When receive packet, send ACK. If packet is corrupted, ignore it andsender will resend.</li><li>SR<br />Send packets from the window and set timeout for each packet. Onreceiving ACK for left side of the window, slide forward and sendpackets that have now entered the window. On timeout, resend only thetimed out packet.<br />Receiver keeps a buffer of size of the window. On receiving packets,send ACK. If packet comes in out of order, just store it in the bufferand send ACK anyway.</li></ul><h2 id="how-big-should-we-size-the-senders-window">How big should wesize the sender's window</h2><p>Don't overload the receiver. Sender cannot send as fast as possiblesince it will overflow the receiver's buffer.<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200417151819468.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />The solution is Advertised Window (W): tell the sender how much spacethe receiver's buffer has through ACK. So the window size of the sender:the size &lt;= W. Thus we won't overload the receiver. This is FlowControl.</p><p>But if we set the size to W, we cannot solve the problemthoroughly:<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2021022516554078.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />Sender's window contains a set of packets that have been transmitted butnot yet acked. But some packets will get dropped at router and senderwill never receive ACKs for these packets. The result is these packetswill remain buffered in the window. It means that we cannot set the sizeto W, we only want to send at 50Mbps. It will take a RTT(200ms) toreceive an ACK back for the first packet. We will send 50*200=1.25MBdata and that's exactly the definition of the sender's window.</p><p>The window size of the sender should &lt;= bandwidth-delay product(BDP). Thus we won't overload the network. This is Congestion Control.BDP is the "volume" of the link, the amount of data that can be "inflight" at any time.</p><h2 id="how-should-we-determine-the-bdp">How should we determine theBDP</h2><p>Things are much harder to calculate the BDP:</p><ul><li>We don't know the bandwidth or RTT</li><li>My share of bandwidth is dependent on the other user on the network,so the window size will change as other users start or stop sending</li><li>The router will stall the excess packets in the bottleneck queueinstead of dropping, so you can overshoot the size a little bit</li></ul><p>There are many algorithms to solve the problem given the priorconstraints. The old one is Reno, although no one uses it anymore,sigh!!</p><p>Use Multiplicative Increase at startup to find the right sending ratequickly, this process is called "slow start";<br />Then uses Additive Increase/Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) to adjust thesending rate over time.<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210225174103869.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /></p><h2 id="reference">Reference</h2><p><a href="https://computer-networks.github.io/sp19/lectures.html">CMU15-441 TCP Part 2</a></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>自从贝叶斯理论诞生以后，频率学派和贝叶斯学派的争论一直没有停歇，平时的学习太注重公式计算，故在此谈谈自己对贝叶斯理论的一些认识。</p><p>频率学派认为概率是基于大量实验所得的定值（大数定理），比如抛掷一枚材质均匀的硬币10000次，出现正面的次数有4995次，反面的次数有5005次，大致认为出现正反面的概率都是50%。然而现实生活中很多事情是无法做大量实验的，比如某人得心脏病的概率是5%，显然我们无法通过多次实验来计算出这个概率值。回到硬币的例子，如果只允许你抛5次，5次的结果都是正面，那么出现正面的概率是100%了吗？显然这是存在弊端的。</p><p>再来看一个非常经典的医学上的例子：有一种很稀有的病，得病的人检测结果呈阳性的概率是0.9，没得病的人检测结果呈阴性的概率也是0.9，人们患这种病的概率是0.01。如果某人的检测结果呈阳性，那么他患这种病的概率是多少？</p><p>直观上看：患病的人检测呈阳性的概率是0.9，这个人被检测为阳性，那么有很大概率这个人是患病的。不妨试着算算：</p><p>假设用A表示检测结果为阳性，B表示患病，那么可以很轻松的计算出： <spanclass="math display">\[P(B|A)=\frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A)}=\frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A|B)P(B)+P(A|\barB)P(\bar B)}=\frac{0.9*0.01}{0.9*0.01+0.1*0.99}=0.083 \\P(\bar B|A)=1-P(B|A)=0.917\]</span>可以看到：即使检测结果呈阳性，患病的概率仍然只有8.3%，和我们的直观认识并不相同。</p><p>上面的计算其实就用了贝叶斯公式：后验概率<spanclass="math inline">\(P(B|A)\)</span>等于条件概率<spanclass="math inline">\(P(A|B)\)</span>（似然函数）乘以先验概率<spanclass="math inline">\(P(B)\)</span>，再除以一个常数因子。我们在已知先验概率的前提下，通过新的观测值<spanclass="math inline">\(P(A|B)\)</span>（检测结果是否阳性）来预测患病的概率。</p><p>关于常数因子<spanclass="math inline">\(P(A)\)</span>可以这样理解：分子<spanclass="math inline">\(P(A,B)\)</span>表示检测结果呈阳性并且患病的概率，那么还有一部分人<spanclass="math inline">\(P(A,\barB)\)</span>检测结果呈阳性但是没有患病，<spanclass="math inline">\(P(A,B)+P(A,\bar B)=P(A)\)</span>，我们要求的<spanclass="math inline">\(P(B|A)\)</span>即检测呈阳性的人中患病的人所占的比例<spanclass="math inline">\(\frac{P(A,B)}{P(A)}\)</span>。</p><p>更加一般的贝叶斯公式：</p><p>如果参数<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>的分布是离散的：<span class="math display">\[\pi(\theta_i|x)=\cfrac{\pi(\theta_i)f(x|\theta_i)}{\sum_{i}\pi(\theta_i)f(x|\theta_i)}\]</span> 如果参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>的分布是连续的： <spanclass="math display">\[\pi(\theta|x)=\cfrac{\pi(\theta)f(x|\theta)}{\int_{\Theta}\pi(\theta)f(x|\theta)d\theta}\]</span> 后验概率密度表示在已知x的前提下关于参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>的一个概率密度函数，即<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>是一个分布，而不是一个固定的值，这是贝叶斯学派与传统学派最大的不同。</p><p>似然函数<spanclass="math inline">\(f(x|\theta)\)</span>可以这么理解：每个事件的背后都有一个分布，这个分布里是含有参数的，并且传统学派认为这个参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>是固定的，我们做了大量的实验，用很多样本x就是为了求出这个参数的值，观测到的样本x是以参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>为前提的一个分布。为了估计<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>，我们用到了<strong>矩估计</strong>和<strong>极大似然估计</strong>，本质上都是一样的，我们在参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>的前提下，从总体X中采样n个样本，用样本的性质来大致替代总体的参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>。具体到极大似然：通过找到使似然函数<spanclass="math inline">\(\prod_{i=1}^{n}f(x_i|\theta)\)</span>最大的参数当作<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>，其实就是选择一个<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>使得样本出现的概率最大，本质上仍然是在拟合样本数据。</p><p>从上面的分析可以看出：我们的未知参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>是从样本中计算得到的，必然和总体中原本的参数值存在误差，并且只能求得一个固定的参数值。贝叶斯理论认为：参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>不应该是一个单独的值，更加合理的解释应该是参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>有很多取值，并且每个取值都有相应的概率，即参数是服从某种分布的。概率最大的那个参数值即<strong>最大后验估计</strong>，参数取值的中位数即<strong>后验中位数估计</strong>，参数取值的均值即<strong>后验期望估计</strong>。为什么仍然叫估计呢？因为我们的后验分布是从似然计算得到的，我们无法采样所有的总体中的样本，所以也就无法计算出参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>的精确分布。</p><p>最后来看看先验分布<spanclass="math inline">\(\pi(\theta)\)</span>，即在获得实验观测值之前对未知参数分布的一个主观认识，这也是贝叶斯学派一直被攻击的一点，客观的统计学中竟然引入了主观的因素！比如对于材质均匀的硬币，在抛掷之前，我们脑海中就会认为出现正反面的概率各是0.5。</p><p>但是很多时候先验分布是很难获得的，如果硬币材质不均匀，我们的先验又应当是什么分布呢？此时就引入了课程上讲的<strong>无信息先验</strong>，当我们对事件没有了解的时候，认为参数所有取值的概率都是相等的，在硬币实验中，我们认为<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>是服从(0,1)的均匀分布。接着我们来做实验，看看后验分布会怎么变化（图源：CameronDavidson-Pilon, Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods forHackers, 2016）：</p><figure><imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/img_convert/11e883581dd48f9c8442b8273371766d.png"alt="img" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">img</figcaption></figure><figure><imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/img_convert/3110af9ecffd601bb7acd89d86ad9784.png"alt="img" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">img</figcaption></figure><p>从图中可以看出：起初是均匀分布，连续抛掷了2次正面，此时认为该硬币正面向上的概率为1的可能性是最大的，但注意：正面向上的概率取0.6,0.4的可能也不是没有，不过这种可能性更小罢了。如果我们用极大似然去估计，就会得到该硬币正面向上的概率是1，正面向上的概率取0.6,0.4的可能为0，这显然与现实不符！接着抛了一次反面，正面向上的概率分布又进行了修正，不断通过观测值修正我们的后验，最终得到一个稳定的后验分布。</p><p>均匀分布<spanclass="math inline">\(U(a,b)\)</span>作为先验看起来很好用，但是他本质上还是有倾向性的，即认为在区间(a,b)内是有取值的，在区间外是没有取值的可能的，更加合理的无信息先验可以选取一个大方差的高斯分布。</p><p>选择高斯分布作为先验带来的一个问题是计算上的复杂性骤然提高，所以引入了<strong>共轭先验分布</strong>：即后验分布<spanclass="math inline">\(\pi(\theta|x)\)</span>与先验分布<spanclass="math inline">\(\pi(\theta)\)</span>是同一种类型的分布，就称先验分布<spanclass="math inline">\(\pi(\theta)\)</span>是<spanclass="math inline">\(f(x|\theta)\)</span>的共轭先验分布。这样我们在计算后验分布时，就无需计算复杂的积分，只要调整先验分布的参数即可确定后验分布。可以证明：<spanclass="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>分布是二项分布<spanclass="math inline">\(B(n,p)\)</span>中参数<spanclass="math inline">\(p\)</span>的共轭先验分布。即如果总体<spanclass="math inline">\(X|\theta\simB(N,\theta)\)</span>，从中采样n个样本，样本分布即似然函数<spanclass="math inline">\(f(x|\theta)\)</span>服从<spanclass="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>分布，假设先验<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\sim\beta(a,b)\)</span>，那么后验分布<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta|x\sim\beta(a+\sum x_i,b+nN-\sumx_i)\)</span>。</p><p>证明： 总体<span class="math inline">\(X|\theta\simB(N,\theta)\)</span>，先验<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\sim\beta(a,b)\)</span>，<spanclass="math inline">\(X=(X_1,...,X_n)^T\)</span>是来自总体的n个样本，则样本分布为：<span class="math display">\[p(x|\theta)=L(\theta)=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\tbinom{N}{x_i}\theta^{x_i}(1-\theta)^{N-x_i}\propto\theta^{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i}(1-\theta)^{nN-\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i}\]</span> 可以看到：似然函数<spanclass="math inline">\(L(\theta)\)</span>具有<spanclass="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>分布的核，先验的核为<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta^{a-1}(1-\theta)^{b-1}\)</span>，所以后验为：<span class="math display">\[\pi(\theta|x)\propto\theta^{a-1+\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i}(1-\theta)^{b-1+nN-\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i},0&lt;\theta&lt;1\]</span> 显然后验分布的核与<spanclass="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>分布的核是同种类型，即<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta|x\sim\beta(a+\sum x_i,b+nN-\sumx_i)\)</span>，所以<spanclass="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>分布是二项分布<spanclass="math inline">\(B(n,p)\)</span>中参数<spanclass="math inline">\(p\)</span>的共轭先验分布。</p>]]></content>

id="多任务下如何保持高效率"><ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/374401049/answer/1055275763">多任务下如何保持高效率</a></h2><p>第一件事情，是想一想什么事情是自己应该做的，什么是要推给别人的，什么是要找人讨论再做，什么需要等一阵子的。这个是战略问题，比任何战术上的技巧都管用。多任务完成得再快，做自己不应该做或者不需要做的事情，只会累死累活还没什么用。</p><p>随时想着如果不玩这局棋了，把棋盘掀翻重来会是什么结果？也许会有更好的解法。</p><p>在这之后，再讨论战术。以下是一些应付多任务的具体方案：</p><ol type="1"><li>每做一个任务要百分百集中（比如说现在在写这个答案的时候，就不要写一半刷手机了）。</li><li>每个任务最好持续一段时间（我的经验是最少15分钟），切去一个需要一定脑力的任务，做5分钟再切回来基本上没有成功的例子。10分钟的任务除非在做之前有非常清楚的规划，不然要不什么事都没做成（比如说还在手忙地找浏览器里的相关标签页），要不因为专注而超时。</li><li>每个任务有非常明确的完成指标。比如说某个任务是代码能跑起来，文章的introduction看完，或是审完一篇论文并且写出评审建议。不完成不要停手。如果实在得要暂停（比如说得去开会），记得把完成指标再分得更细一些。</li><li>难的和简单的任务可以错开做。做完难的需要休息可以做些简单但不得不做的，做完简单的可以再切回难的（这样有挑战性）。如果发现自己并不需要休息就迫不及待地去做下一个任务了，说明任务安排得好。</li><li>不要安排得太满，不要要求每天都一定要全部完成。总会有完不成的事项。我觉得我每天订的TODOlist总有一两个没完成，然后就会发现，有些其实并不重要，有些其实挺重要但下意识逃避了，下次就要把它们拿出来第一个做完。</li><li>经常锻炼，充足睡眠，合理膳食，才能保持充沛精力。偶尔熬夜也许确实活多，但天天熬夜，就说明战略上有大问题了，身体不是这么玩的。</li></ol><h2 id="应届生是选择一个公司还是选择一个行业"><ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/27032313/answer/315544084">应届生是选择一个公司，还是选择一个行业</a></h2><p>人生的幸福，我的感觉来自自律，独立思考能力，控制住自己的欲望，保持对新事物的敏感度和参与度。</p><p>比选择行业更重要的是一个人独立思考能力，自己纠错，自己拯救自己的能力。</p><p>我混到今天一直在自己做决策，从大学填写志愿，到跳槽，找工作，做生意，都从来不问别人，都是自己研究琢磨。我也有问人的时候，但是我从来不问人生该怎么选择，我只问具体的技术性问题。</p><p>保持对物欲的控制，管理好自己，培养良好的习惯，我们可以摆脱很多不必要的麻烦。</p><h2 id="你生命中最艰难痛苦的一段时间是如何度过的"><ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/24917544/answer/154775610">你生命中最艰难、痛苦的一段时间是如何度过的</a></h2><p>对于我来说，从来没有觉得有什么最艰难和痛苦的日子。人生本来就是一场旅行，能够和爱的人在一起度过，又何必在意旅途的风景是什么风格。也许，这场旅途对于我来说，只是可能比父母和孩子早下车几站而已。</p><p>当你用心拼尽全力过好每一天，会发现早死晚死都是一种平淡无奇的结果，艰难困苦只是自己给自己懦弱和懒惰的开脱词。祝尚有余生的各位安好。</p><h2 id="活着不开心怎么办"><ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/29956916/answer/311913864">活着不开心怎么办</a></h2><p>如何减少不开心？一是别瞎去比较，人确实都有损失厌恶，但你如果不主动去做一些无谓的比较，就能让自己舒服很多；另一个是别瞎揣摩别人，别因为不理解别人，而给自己制造不必要的不快。</p><p>说完这两点还没完，因为它俩都属于“别做什么”，还要再聊一点“要做什么”。</p><p>要自在如风，要在不违反法律、不伤风败俗的前提下去尽情享受生活，享受自由。</p><p>我以前觉得那些走在马路上唱着歌还唱得不好听的人特别蠢，可是人家一点都不蠢，他唱歌的样子就能证明他很快乐。</p><p>那些跳广场舞的大妈，人家是真的开心，在跳舞的过程中，她们是心情愉悦的，不然谁会每天都准点跑去跳啊。</p><p>咱们也得好好对待自己，别老那么在意别人的目光，人家路人其实压根就不在意你。</p><h2 id="如何看待论调所谓稳定不过是在浪费生命"><ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/278108330/answer/400776080">如何看待论调「所谓稳定不过是在浪费生命」</a></h2><p>纸醉金迷可能会有一时之爽，但午夜梦回，浮现在眼前的是孩提时代的无忧无虑，还是高档场所的推杯换盏，真不一定。</p><p>内心的平安才是真正的平安。</p><p>人活着，要常常问自己，到底想要什么。不要总跟别人比较，不要过于苛求自己。和自己相识，和自己和解。</p><p>盗用头文字D的一句台词，这世界上只有一种成功，就是能够用自己喜欢的方式度过一生，这才是成功最返璞归真的定义。</p><h2 id="我们是怎样一步步地走向平庸的"><ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/33220674/answer/58248246">我们是怎样一步步地走向平庸的</a></h2><p>认为我这么一个大好人才，却被投闲置散，落至今时今日这样的田地。</p><p>也试过自怨自艾，认为自己不知不觉间变成了一个废人。</p><p>直到这个时候，我才知道，我之所以觉得亲朋好友们的夸赞大惊小怪，其实是因为在我心底，我一直以为自己本来就应该是个天之骄子。</p><p>一路以来走得太过顺畅，我以为自己并不高傲自大，其实这种高傲自大已经深入骨髓，我根本没有机会察觉。</p><p>及至看到周围那些，曾经和我一个水平，甚至不如我的人，踏踏实实地走每一步，一步一步地抛离我，我才慢慢意识到，我并不是什么天之骄子，我只是一个平平凡凡的人。</p><p>接受自己是一个庸人这个过程非常痛苦。我每天都在剧烈的内心煎熬中。</p><p>一时劝说自己，生来便是庸人，坦然接受便是。一时又斗志激昂，只要努力，我便能回到原来天之骄子的位置上。</p><p>食不能安，夜不能寐。精神的压力直接导致身体的衰弱，一度卧病在床。</p><p>每个人都理所当然地演绎着自己的每一日。</p><p>相比之下，我国内的朋友，最近一个个结婚生子，安居乐业。我的妹妹，看起来学历能力一切不如我，却兢兢业业安安稳稳地工作着，闲时与朋友吃吃烧烤喝喝啤酒，上瑜伽班，学画画，日子过得不亦乐乎。</p><p>你说这样是平庸吗？然而她却觉得幸福无比。我拿着两个名校的学位又一次进入了名企，努力了那么久，曾经我以为我也算一直在进步，最后也不过是朝九晚五地工作。</p><p>而此时此刻，我只想回到家人的身边，过那带着油烟味的乏味无奇的日子。</p><p>我想，大千世界，谁人不平庸谁人平庸，一切不过是心魔。努力上进也好，安稳度日也好，若是不幸福不快乐，又有何用。</p><h2 id="大学毕业之后同学之间慢慢拉开了差距还有必要参加老同学聚会吗"><ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/20004337/answer/18961389">大学毕业之后，同学之间慢慢拉开了差距，还有必要参加老同学聚会吗</a></h2><p>唯有真正的好朋友，你过得好，他们反倒会问候你，这样累不累，不累就好；你过得不好，他们也会真心体贴你：「没关系，加油，做你自己想做的事，兄弟帮不到你，但你不开心的时候，可以找兄弟出来喝喝酒、吃吃饭、唱唱歌，哥儿几个陪你。」</p><p>当朋友之间不用显示优越感时，就能好好聊天了。</p><h2 id="如何让自己变得开心起来"><ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/20657503/answer/28028792">如何让自己变得开心起来</a></h2><p>不要和他人比较。我在精神病院工作，我可以直截了当的告诉你：太多看上去成功和开心的人被自己内心的骚动活活折磨疯了。所以，只要专注自己就好。</p><p>参与社交。即使你是一个内向的人，也要强迫自己去进入社交环节，这会给你和人结识、建立联系的机会。这些联系会使你和你的人性连接在一起。</p><p>做有关健康的决策。运动和好的饮食会改变你的世界观，这是很神奇的。你脑中看起来很真实很迫切的消极想法会消失的。</p><p>做不一样的事情。不要再浪费时间试图找到“完美的爱好”了。学习一点新的，无论是纤维艺术还是品尝咖啡。找到一件你可以投入精力的东西，自己能够胜任，然后等待结果。</p><p>和转折点保持联系。当我们长大的时候我们就慢慢失去了那些转折点。试着在任何一个你觉得亲切的群体里更好的安置自己，无论那个群体是你的家庭，你的邻居，你的文明，或是你的种族。</p><p>少往前看，少往后看。试着更多关注现在的自己。开始建立回忆而不是活在回忆里。开始创造你的未来而不是期待更好的未来。如果你不这样做，你的生活就会成为一片雾，横跨你的整个人生。（在某个阶段做事时候，不要总想着下一阶段，专注于现在。）</p><p>创造。在旅行中书写，或者画点什么。写一首歌，即使你从未演奏它。当你走的时候，开始改变你遗留下来的纪念品。</p><p>放手。原谅那些伤害你的人。我很遗憾你受到了伤害。但是如果你不将那些伤痛留在过去，它就会像狼一样跟着你——当你做任何事情的时候，它永远扮演着一个危险的影子。</p><p>更多的为他人担心。很多时候是我们的自恋毁了我们。这听上去很反直觉，但是每天花些时间想想你生活中人们的需求。帮助他们实现一些需求会使你更加开心，这个你现在可能不会理解。</p><p>停止奔跑。其实没有一个地方是“在远处”的。你想旅行多远就多远，但是当你到达那里的时候，你将始终发现你在等待着自己。拔出你的剑。是时候回头和你心中的巨龙搏斗了。</p><h2 id="关于高考你印象最深的是什么"><ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/24047876/answer/37943380">关于高考，你印象最深的是什么</a></h2><p>高考前的人生轻薄如纸，越往后走，生活才越显出复杂与沉重的本来面目。</p><p>我希望各位能在高考中取得好成绩，但我更希望，当你们背负着越来越沉重的人生往前走时，依然不会失去感受幸福的能力。</p><p>从知道得病至今我一直坦然和平静，我总是想，人不能只允许自己遇到好事，不允许自己遇到坏事。当不顺或困境找到我时，我会反问自己：为什么不可以是我？于是就能平静地去面对。</p><h2 id="这样的努力真的有意义吗"><ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/23606484/answer/25156325">这样的努力真的有意义吗</a></h2><p>强者懂得，不管喜欢与否，现有的事情要做得漂亮。才有资格在人生方向确定时，发现自己已经有充分的积累，实现他们的梦想。</p><p>不管你是什么level的，永远有无数的人跟你同一个level，而你只要不断努力，就能超过这些本来跟你同level的人。</p><h2 id="你是如何变得不浮躁的"><ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/19627497/answer/15875565">你是如何变得不浮躁的</a></h2><p>浮躁是因为急于求成而产生的一种不安的心理。心中总是想着做更多的事情，更快的获得成功，更快的抵达自己的目标，使我们忘记了，我们是为什么去做一件事情。</p><p>做一件事的最重要的是求的心灵的安宁。当我们充满激情的想做完成一件作品时，我们的心不是安宁的。一直到作品呈现出，它应该有的形式，我们心灵才获得了安宁，才获得了喜悦。</p><p>然而当你想着赶快做完一件事的时候，就说明你不再关心此事，而是想着下一件事，你匆匆忙忙的应付了眼前的事，然后又赶紧开始下一件事，你的心没有得到过安宁。前面事情又做的不够好，你会更不安，更浮躁。戒浮躁就要做好当下的事，投入你的热忱，直到做好它，那时你的心才得到安宁。</p><p>高僧把扫地也当成他生活的一部分，他沉浸于扫地这个过程，直到把地扫干净，他获得了心灵的安宁，这种安宁对他来说比任何东西都重要。他过得是一种沉浸式的生活。而心浮气躁的人总是过着肤浅的生活。</p><p>放慢自己做事情的速度，投入自己的热忱。不要着急地去做一件事情，先端正自己的态度，寻找做此事的热忱。</p><p>冥想，静坐，都是不错的训练方法。</p><h2 id="能否用一百字写清楚你最想要的生活"><ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/34970791/answer/63071829">能否用一百字写清楚你最想要的生活</a></h2><p>冬。 大雪。 小火炉。 热巧克力。 温暖的沙发。 脚边打滚的猫。阳台上赏雪的狗。 笼子里好动的仓鼠。 靠在我肩上瞌睡的你。水瓶里开得正盛的鲜花。 爸妈刚打来一个电话。 你们有空回来喝茶。我给你盖上被子。 没想吵醒你啦。 你揉了揉眼。 一起睡吧。 那好吧。 讨厌！哈。</p><h2 id="如何做一个让人眼前一亮的presentation"><ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/28639137/answer/374782107">如何做一个让人眼前一亮的presentation</a></h2><p>当然，不同场合需要不同的风格，但是整体流程一定要像讲故事一样，大致有3步：</p><ol

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>程序性能的衡量一般有2种方式：Benchmarking和Profiling。 ##BenchmarkingBenchmarking通过绝对运行时间来比较程序的整体性能，例如给定一组同样的输入，比较不同版本的程序在同样硬件环境下的运行时间，或者比较相同版本程序在不同硬件环境下的运行时间。</p><h2 id="profiling">Profiling</h2><p>Profiling通常用来识别程序的耗时瓶颈（通常是一些函数），优化这些瓶颈后再去做Benchmarking评估整体性能。<br />Unix系统提供了GPROF工具，CSAPP上有一个示例：</p><ul><li>编译：<code>gcc -Og -pg prog.c -o prog</code><br /><code>-Og</code>表示关闭了很多编译器的优化开关，并且优化了调试信息；<code>-pg</code>表示产生供GPROF剖析用的可执行文件。</li><li>执行：<code>./prog file.txt</code><br />会比正常执行要慢一些（慢一倍左右），生成待分析的文件<code>gmon.out</code>。</li><li>分析：<code>gprof prog</code></li></ul><p>结果通常有2部分。<br />第一部分是不同函数的耗时情况：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20201012215440170.png#pic_center"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />第4列显示了该函数被调用了多少次（不含递归调用），库函数一般不显示在列表中，但是可以通过wrapperfunction去显示它的执行情况。<br />第二部分是函数的调用情况，以递归函数<code>find_ele_rec</code>为例：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20201012220111993.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />前2行显示了调用该函数的情况：自己递归调用了158555725次，被<code>insert_string</code>调用了965027次，<code>insert_string</code>自己递归调用了965027次；后几行显示了<code>find_ele_rec</code>调用其他函数的情况。</p><p>由于GPROF采用的是intervalcounting，所以计时可能不太精确，尤其对于运行时间小于1s的程序误差更大。<br />如何使用Profiling去优化程序，CSAPP上给了一个非常精彩的例子，这里不再赘述。</p>]]></content>

Lists</li><li><strong>Placement Policy</strong>:有多个满足要求的空闲块，如何选择以放置新的申请：First Fit, Next Fit,Best Fit</li><li>Splitting:在一个空闲块放置申请后如何处理剩余的空闲空间。可以直接将整个空闲块分配出去，也可以将剩余的空闲空间重新利用；</li><li>无法找到合适的满足请求的块：做空闲块合并后再次检查是否可以满足；用<code>sbrk</code>向内核申请更多的内存，插入空闲链表；</li><li><strong>空闲块合并</strong>：需要考虑何时合并：立即合并（可能引发抖动）、延迟合并（申请失败时合并整个堆里所有的空闲块）；合并后面的块很容易，但是要高效合并前面的空闲块，需要用双向的BoundaryTag(可以优化以减少空间开销)；</li></ul><p>不仅需要记录每块的大小，还需要区分已分配块和空闲块，所以block的格式可以设计如下：<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20201011195117307.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> 如果要求double-word(8B)对齐，那么Blocksize总是8的倍数，所以低3位都是0，可以利用其存储分配状态。</p><p>这样整个堆就可以组织为连续的分配和空闲块，由于已经存储了每块的大小，所以隐式空闲链表就应运而生：<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20201014165121101.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /></p><p>隐式空闲链表的优点就是实现简单，缺点就是当需要在所有的空闲块中查找时（如placement），需要扫描整个堆（包括已经分配的块）。显式链表的分配时间复杂度是<spanclass="math inline">\(O(free)\)</span>，速度较慢但是如果采取bestfit，内存利用率会比segregated free lists好一些。</p><p>为了降低隐式空闲链表合并的复杂度，Knuth大佬提出了boundarytags，这样实际上相当于隐式双向链表： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20201011214226551.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /></p><p>这样就可以通过Footer在<spanclass="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span>检查之前的块的状态及其开始位置，缺点在于如果小的内存块比较多的话，内存浪费太大。<br />双向tag带来的内存开销可以优化：只有前面的块是空闲，才需要它footer里的大小，所以可以在每个块用后3位里的某一位来存储前面块的状态，那么已分配块就不需要footer了，可以把footer的空间用来当作payload，但是空闲块仍然需要2个tag。</p><p>那么现在整个堆变成了这样： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20201016204303577.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> 这里的<code>heap_listp</code>指向Prologueblock的中间是做了一些小优化，方便直接定位到下一块的数据位置。</p><p>这里的实现非常tricky和subtle，一开始只申请了4words共16B(unused(1)+Prologue(2)+Epilogue(1))，后续的<code>extend_heap</code>申请一个空闲块后，将原来的Epilogue作为空闲块的header，空闲块的最后一个word变为新的Epilogue。</p><p>由于对齐要求（Headers在非对齐位置，Payloads对齐），分配器应该有一个minimumblock size，即使只请求了1B，也要分配minimum block size，这里是16B。</p><p>写代码时先实现并测试<code>malloc</code>和<code>free</code>，如果能正确并且高效执行，再去实现<code>realloc</code>。</p><h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2><p>性能主要考虑2方面因素：</p><ul><li>空间利用率<span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>：peakratio即评测程序申请的总内存（<code>mm_malloc/mm_realloc</code>但是还没有<code>mm_free</code>）与分配器使用的堆容量的比值，需要用好的策略减小碎片，使得该值接近1；</li><li>吞吐量<spanclass="math inline">\(T\)</span>：每秒完成的操作数量</li></ul><p>评测程序会综合考虑2个方面，计算一个performance index <spanclass="math display">\[P=wU+(1-w)min(1,\frac{T}{T_{libc}})\]</span><spanclass="math inline">\(T_{libc}\)</span>是<code>libc</code>中的<code>malloc</code>的吞吐量，大概在600Kops/s左右，<spanclass="math inline">\(w=0.6\)</span>。 这个<spanclass="math inline">\(P\)</span>既考虑了内存资源，又考虑了CPU资源，两个矛盾的指标需要适当权衡。</p><p>第一个版本<code>mm1.c</code>基本就是抄书，Implicit Free Lists+FirstFit+Bi Boundary Tag，抄书也就将将及格。。 <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20201115143013580.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> 将First-Fit改成Next-Fit，还不错： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20201115202312126.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" />可以看到：Next-Fit在速度上有很大提升，主要是因为它是从上次终止的块开始搜索，避免了前面很多块的无效搜索。</p><p>最后对于Implicit Lists的性能做个总结：<br />分配：<span class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span><br />释放：<span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span><br />Memory Overhead：取决于First Fit等策略</p><p>感觉这个性能已经不错了，但是一些无聊的计算机科学家还是不满意分配时的效率。接着我们看下更加🐂🍺的方法SegregatedFree Lists： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20201024204031234.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> 每个size级别的块都有自己的freelist，分配大小为n的块时：</p><ul><li>搜索合适的free list使得size&gt;n</li><li>找到：split并将remainder放入应该去的list</li><li>未找到：向操作系统申请更大的内存，分出去n，将剩下的放入相应的list</li></ul><p>释放时合并空闲块并且放入相应的free list即可。</p><p>这实际上近似模拟了Best Fit，而且不用搜索整个free list，BestFit一般有着最优的内存利用率，但是运行时间<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span>，又是吞吐量和内存利用率的trade-off，终于明白了为什么官方的<code>malloc</code>要用这个方式了：吞吐量更大<spanclass="math inline">\(O(lgn)\)</span>、更优的内存利用率Best Fit。</p><p>Segregated FreeLists中的空闲块包含Header+prev+next+padding+Footer，已分配块没有前后指针。写代码要注意：整个堆中的块位置是不变的，只是状态（分配、释放）在改变，整个堆中的空闲块是用seglist的方式串起来的。</p><p>Debug可以自己写一下<code>mm_check</code>，还是很有用的。<code>realloc</code>快de疯了，整整一个晚上。。。其实就4种情况：</p><ol type="1"><li>如果当前已分配块后面是结尾块，直接申请新的堆空间，与原块组合返回；</li><li>如果当前已分配块后面是一个空闲块，且两者之和&gt;=size，组合返回；</li><li>如果当前已分配块后是一个空闲块，但两者之和&lt;size，但是空闲块后是结束块，申请新的堆空间，三者组合返回；</li><li>malloc新块，将原块复制，释放原块。</li></ol><p>第一次写完，只有85，内存利用率太差了： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20201117220719669.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><code>place</code>的时候，如果申请块比较大，我们将其分配到后半部分，将前半部分切割为空闲：<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2020111909030584.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> 之前class的划分是1，2-3，4-7，8-15...但是最小块是16B，所以16B以下的用不到，所以改为0-16B，17-32，...，257-512MB</p><p>这样优化后直接96： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20201119092357832.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" />后面还可以继续优化榨干性能，比如去掉已分配块的Footer，<code>realloc</code>组合块以后对remainder进行split...<br />以后有时间再说......</p><h2

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>EnsembleLearning的基本思想就是将多个基学习器组合在一起，产生泛化能力更强的模型。<br />组合策略有许多种，包括Voting、平均法和Stacking等，Stacking就是选择某种学习器作为组合基学习器的方式。<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200926193430376.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />既然要结合多个基学习器的优点，那么基学习器的选择最好是“准而不同”，元学习器一般选择比较简单的模型（如逻辑回归），防止过拟合。<br />比较简单的想法就是将全部训练集用于训练基学习器，将基学习器的预测结果作为元学习器的训练集，从而得到整个模型。<br />这样做的问题在于：基学习器最终在训练集上的表现非常好，再用基学习器在该训练集上的预测结果作为次级训练集，同样元学习器在该训练集上表现也会非常好，但是模型的泛化能力不一定很好，有过拟合的风险。<br />因此，采用K折交叉验证的方式，用训练基学习器未使用的样本来产生次级训练集。<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20201109191045436.jpg"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />具体来讲：<br />在训练阶段（假设训练集<spanclass="math inline">\(400*10\)</span>），对于每个基学习器（假设有3个基学习器），进行5次训练与验证，得到<spanclass="math inline">\(400*1\)</span>的验证结果，那么最终次级训练集是<spanclass="math inline">\(400*3\)</span>（类标签还是原始类标签），用这些数据训练次级学习器，完成后再用全部的训练集训练所有的基学习器（可选，提高基学习器性能）；<br />在测试阶段，如果训练阶段选了最后一步，那么每个基学习器直接得到一个结果，就会得到3个测试结果，送入次级学习器，得到最终的预测结果；如果训练时没有选最后一步，那么每个基学习器都有5个小模型，将测试样本用5个小模型分别测试，将5个结果平均得到某个基学习器的预测结果，也会得到3个测试结果。<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20201109192340496.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />Weka里的实现：</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br><span class="line">32</span><br><span class="line">33</span><br><span class="line">34</span><br><span class="line">35</span><br><span class="line">36</span><br><span class="line">37</span><br><span class="line">38</span><br><span class="line">39</span><br><span class="line">40</span><br><span class="line">41</span><br><span class="line">42</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">/**</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">   * Buildclassifier selects a classifier from the set of classifiers</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">   * by minimising error on the training data.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">   *</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">   * <span class="doctag">@param</span> data the training data to be used for generating the</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">   * boosted classifier.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">   * <span class="doctag">@throws</span> Exception if the classifier could not be built successfully</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">   */</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// 建立整个模型</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">buildClassifier</span><span class="params">(Instances data)</span> <span class="keyword">throws</span> Exception </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> (m_MetaClassifier == <span class="keyword">null</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      <span class="keyword">throw</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span class="string">&quot;No meta classifier has been set&quot;</span>);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// 判断分类器是否有能力处理该数据集</span></span><br><span class="line">    getCapabilities().testWithFail(data);</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// 删除类标签缺失数据</span></span><br><span class="line">    Instances newData = <span class="keyword">new</span> Instances(data);</span><br><span class="line">    m_BaseFormat = <span class="keyword">new</span> Instances(data, <span class="number">0</span>);</span><br><span class="line">    newData.deleteWithMissingClass();</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    Random random = <span class="keyword">new</span> Random(m_Seed);</span><br><span class="line">    newData.randomize(random);

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>这是CS 61B的Project3，也是最后一个Proj。刚好上完这门课出去旅个游，放松下心情开始15213。<br />完成基本的要求花了5天时间，当然现在的版本还十分简陋，这个工程我是想做得比较大，后面还得抽时间消化理解、完善优化。</p><p>SP18用了<a href="https://maven.apache.org/">ApacheMaven</a>做项目建构工具，<ahref="https://blog.csdn.net/qq_41431457/article/details/102999439">折腾</a>了一天也没有配好，<del>不知道这么垃圾的工具有啥用</del>，最后实在没辙就把该项目所有需要的jar包导进来，后来发现SP19就抛弃了maven。<br /><img src="1.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />项目需要的地图集以及地图上的点/路信息都是Google采集好的，可在<ahref="https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B">这里</a>下载，当然这个地图只是一小部分，后面想要扩展可以去下载需要的<ahref="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">数据集</a>，包括tile images和mapfeature data。</p><p>整体需求是实现一个网页端地图，用户通过浏览器输入URL，Java程序接收，然后生成相应的地图结果并返回，在浏览器中显示。服务器框架用的是<ahref="http://sparkjava.com/documentation.html#getting-started">Spark</a>，前端以及前后端交互的部分已经写好了（TA真的太强了），其实我有时候觉得这些dirty的工作比较考验码力，这些代码写得漂亮说明System的能力是挺强的。</p><p>后端至少需要实现3个类：</p><ul><li><code>Rasterer</code><br />输入upper left latitude and longitude, lower right latitude andlongitude, a window width, and a window height.<br />输出2D array of filenames corresponding to the files to berendered.</li><li><code>GraphDB</code><br />输入Open Street Map数据集，将其转为图存储起来：每个结点是a singleintersection，每条边是一条路。</li><li><code>Router</code><br />输入GraphDB, a starting latitude and longitude, and a destinationlatitude and longitude.<br />输出从起点到终点的一系列结点，以及路径导航信息。</li></ul><h2 id="map-rastering">Map Rastering</h2><p>首先要将用户查询的真实世界的经纬度信息转为实际地图，<code>Rasterer.java</code>会接收用户请求的矩形参数<code>Map&lt;String, Double&gt; params</code>，生成对应的图像名称<code>String[][]</code>：<br />主要工作在<code>getMapRaster()</code>方法中完成，用户输入的查询请求共有6个参数：</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;lrlon=-<span class="number">122.2104604264636</span>, ullon=-<span class="number">122.30410170759153</span>, w=<span class="number">1085.0</span>, h=<span class="number">566.0</span>, ullat=<span class="number">37.870213571328854</span>, lrlat=<span class="number">37.8318576119893</span>&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>表示用户希望显示经度范围<code>lrlon</code>~<code>ullon</code>，纬度范围<code>ullat</code>~<code>lrlat</code>的区域，并且分辨率大概是<code>w*h</code>。</p><p>街景图采用<strong>冗余存储</strong>，所有图片都是<code>256*256</code>：<code>d0_x0_y0.png</code>是整个区域的街景，但是分辨率最低，<code>d1_x0_y0.png/d1_x0_y1.png/d1_x1_y0.png/d1_x1_y1.png</code>分别代表西北/东北/西南/东南四个角的街景，但是分辨率加倍。</p><p>更加规范的说：在第D个缩放级别，共有<spanclass="math inline">\(4^D\)</span>张图片，<code>dD_x0_y0.png</code>到<code>dD_xk_yk.png</code>，<spanclass="math inline">\(k=2^D-1\)</span>，随<code>x</code>增大向东移动，随<code>y</code>增大向南移动，我们需要返回<code>String[][]</code>代表用户请求区域的图片文件名矩阵，当然还有一些其他参数（查询是否成功等）：由于Java只能返回一个值，所以结果组装成<code>Map&lt;String, Object&gt;</code>返回。</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[[d2_x0_y1.png, d2_x1_y1.png, d2_x2_y1.png, d2_x3_y1.png],</span><br><span class="line">[d2_x0_y2.png, d2_x1_y2.png, d2_x2_y2.png, d2_x3_y2.png],</span><br><span class="line">[d2_x0_y3.png, d2_x1_y3.png, d2_x2_y3.png, d2_x3_y3.png]]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>上述返回结果的分辨率为<code>1024*768</code>，几乎满足用户分辨率要求<code>1085*556</code>。</p><p>这样对于同一个区域，可以有很多选择：可以用更多张高分辨率图片的组合，也可以用较少几张低分辨率的图片组合，只要满足用户要求，比如对于上述例子，<code>d2_x0_y1.png</code>可以采用<code>d3_x0_y2.png/d3_x1_y2.png/d3_x0_y3.png/d3_x1_y3.png</code>代替，这样返回的图片是<code>6*8</code>共48张，分辨率可达<code>2048*1536</code>。</p><p>但这样做很可能overflow，远远超过用户要求，浪费时间和资源，因为分辨率高就意味着展示的空间小，并且前端是不会做缩放的，如果用很多高分辨率图片，浏览器会有太多太多照片加载显示，因为大家都是<code>256*256</code>的。</p><p>所以定义单位像素的经度距离：<span class="math inline">\(\text{LonDPP}= \frac{\text{lower right longitude} - \text{upper leftlongitude}}{\text{width of the image (or box) inpixels}}\)</span>，我们要展示的是小于用户要求的LonDPP的最大值，比方说用户要求每个像素2度，如果我们大于2，那么分辨率低到不能满足要求，只有小于2才能满足要求。又不能太小，分辨率太高展示范围变小。当然如果用户要求的LonDPP很低，只能用现有的最低的LonDPP图片，即<code>d7</code>系列。<br />可以将LonDPP理解为模糊程度，LonDPP越大，显示的图片越模糊，比如<code>d0</code>系列就有最大的LonDPP。<br />纬度也要做类似处理。</p><p>举例来看：<code>d2</code>系列共有16张图片，用户请求QueryBox应该返回9张图片：<br /><img src="2.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />具体实现只有1个方法<code>public Map&lt;String, Object&gt; getMapRaster(Map&lt;String, Double&gt; params)</code>，分2步：</p><ul><li>需要的图片的<code>depth</code><br />全图即<code>d0</code>的经纬度范围是：<code>-122.29980, 37.89220/-122.21191, 37.82280</code><br />因为地球不是规则的，但是在确定Depth时，经度方向的LonDPP满足要求即可，不需考虑纬度方向的影响。</li><li>确定四个角的下标</li><li>corner case<br />判断输入是否合法时，边界判断一定要加EPS，不然一点小误差会崩掉程序。<br />输入不合法（用户拖动至全图外等），将<code>query_success</code>置为<code>false</code>返回即可。</li></ul><p>Bug：读取图片文件时，总是<code>javax.imageio.IOException: Can't read input file!</code>。一般都是路径问题。</p><h2 id="routing-location-data">Routing &amp; Location Data</h2><p>明确了前端需要显示哪些图片后，接下来就是要建一个图，因为最后要路径规划嘛。<br />路由和位置数据是通过<code>berkeley-2018.osm.xml</code>文件给的，是整个<ahref="https://download.bbbike.org/osm/">地球数据</a>的一部分，文件格式是<ahref="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_XML">OSM XML</a>。</p><p>解析XML数据用的是SAXParser，遍历每个element，在每个元素的开始和结束位置，调用<code>startElement</code>和<code>endElement</code>回调函数。</p><p>先来熟悉下OSM XML文档：<br /><img src="3.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br /><code>node</code>元素是组成地图的主干，有id/lat/lon等属性。如果结点是一个位置，那么<code>tag</code>标签就会有<code>name</code>，如果是其他的，比如路上的一个点，那么就没有<code>tag</code>。<br /><img src="4.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br /><code>way</code>元素表示一条路，路上可能有很多<code>node</code>，用<code>id</code>表示。<code>tag</code>会包含额外信息，如果<code>name</code>是highway，那么<code>v</code>就是道路类型。假设所有道路都是双向的。</p><p>在类<code>GraphDB</code>中存储图，要求允许插入和删除结点，最后要用<code>clean()</code>清理掉没有连接的结点。<br /><code>GraphBuildingHandler</code>会解析XML文件并调用<code>GraphDB</code>的一些接口函数构建整个图。</p><p>如果选择邻接矩阵存储，由于这是一个动态的图，可能要增加或者删除结点，所以一开始顶点个数是不确定的，也就不能用<code>int[][]</code>表示。所以选择邻接表，因为有<code>clean()</code>操作，需要判断结点是否与其他结点相邻，邻接表速度更快。</p><p><code>GraphBuildingHandler</code>每次只处理XML的一行，也就是一个标签，<code>GraphBuildingHandler</code>这个类可以被其它方法多次调用去处理完所有的XML，我发现这种拆分很有用，系统会变得简单，只需要考虑当前状态就很好写。清楚需求后，需要设计类的接口，数据结构和算法，这才是最难的部分。</p><p>由于parser的解析是从上到下的，所以处理<code>way</code>时最好不要直接把边和边上的结点直接加进图里，因为后面的<code>highway</code>的值可能不在合法范围内，这种边是不算的。所以在碰到边上的点，先存到一个数组里，最后<code>endElement()</code>时候如果路合法，再加进图里。处理<code>node</code>也同理，在<code>endElement()</code>时加入图。记得每次做完一个<code>node</code>或<code>way</code>要<code>clear()</code>上一个的状态信息。</p><p>每个<code>node</code>有一些属性（id/lat/lon），每条边也有一些属性（fromID/toID/name），所以首先要有<code>Node</code>类和<code>Edge</code>类。<br />邻接表的顶点表<code>Map&lt;Long, Node&gt; vertex</code>，边表<code>Map&lt;Long, Set&lt;Edge&gt;&gt; adj</code>。</p><p>Bug：对<code>ArrayList</code>等在迭代时同时进行修改就会引发异常<code>ConcurrentModificationException</code>。</p><p><code>long closest(double lon, double lat)</code>方法会被用来找最短路，需要返回最近的<strong>有邻居</strong>的<code>node</code>，一个点可能没有邻居，因为他是饭店啥的，不能用来找最短路。另外，这个方法复杂度要求<spanclass="math inline">\(O(lgn)\)</span>，先实现一个<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span>的做法，后续有时间再去优化吧。</p><h2 id="route-search">Route Search</h2><p>建好地图后，就要做路由工作：给定起点和终点的经纬度，选一条距离最短的路径，需要在类<code>Router</code>中实现<code>shortestPath</code>方法。<br />应该从距起点最近的<code>node</code>开始导航到距终点最近的<code>node</code>结束，当然这些<code>node</code>必须是connected的。</p><p>两个<code>node</code>间的距离采用<ahref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance">great-circledistance</a>，即当作球模型来计算弧长距离。整体距离就是计算1-2之间、2-3之间...的距离之和，还要考虑经度和纬度有不同的尺度，并且随着纬度变化，每度代表的实际距离也是不同的，还好计算距离的函数已经由🐂🍺的TA写好了。</p><p>最好用A*而不是Dijkstra，启发函数h(n)用结点n到终点的great-circledistance就行，要注意目标不可达的情况。</p><p>开始只能在<code>berkeley-2018-small-osm.xml</code>上跑起来，我以为是笔记本配置太烂，跑大的数据集跑不动，只能用小的来测试，后来发现<code>GraphDB</code>里一行写错了。。。debug真痛苦啊！！</p><p>找到最优路线后，这里有一个optionalfeature，就是显示方向导航信息Turn-by-turnNavigation，需要在类<code>Router</code>中实现<code>routeDirections</code>方法。导航方向的表示是在<code>Router</code>类中写了一个新类<code>NavigationDirection</code>，具体的导航信息格式如下：<br />DIRECTION on WAY for DISTANCE miles<br />其中，DIRECTION有8种选择：</p><ul><li>“Start”</li><li>“Continue straight”</li><li>“Slight left/right”</li><li>“Turn left/right”</li><li>“Sharp left/right”</li></ul><p>所以我们需要确定正确的DIRECTION/WAY/DISTANCE，方向取决于当前结点和上一个节点间的<ahref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(navigation)">relativebearing</a>：</p><ul><li>Between -15 and 15 degrees the direction should be “Continuestraight”.</li><li>Beyond -15 and 15 degrees but between -30 and 30 degrees thedirection should be “Slight left/right”.</li><li>Beyond -30 and 30 degrees but between -100 and 100 degrees thedirection should be “Turn left/right”.</li><li>Beyond -100 and 100 degrees the direction should be “Sharpleft/right”.</li></ul><p>难点在于：一条<code>way</code>上可能包含了若干<code>node</code>，如何在遍历<code>node</code>的过程中判断<code>way</code>是否发生了改变，只有<code>way</code>变化后才能产生一条新的导航信息。如果恰好来到了一条没有<code>name</code>的路，就将WAY设为“unknownroad”。</p><p>举例来说：<br />假设出发的<code>node</code>在“ShattuckAvenue”这条路上，那么DIRECTION应该设为“Start”，遍历接下来的<code>node</code>时，需要累加在这条路上走过的距离，最终到达一个不在“ShattuckAvenue”的<code>node</code>时，设置WAY为“ShattuckAvenue”，DISTANCE为之前的累加值。接着，下一条导航信息的DIRECTION应该根据相对方位计算，WAY是当前<code>node</code>所在的路，DISTANCE重新累加。</p><p>最终的效果：蓝色线表示最优路线：<br /><img src="5.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />单元测试还是非常重要的，只有确保每一个函数都是正确的，最终组合的功能才可能正确。</p><h2 id="autocomplete-and-search">Autocomplete and Search</h2><p>作为一个很有用的Feature，自动补全还是很酷的：搜索地名时只输入一部分，就返回以它开头的所有地名。需要在<code>MapServer</code>类中实现<code>List&lt;String&gt; getLocationsByPrefix(String prefix)</code>方法。</p><p>输入的参数<code>prefix</code>是clean后的字符串：除了大小写字母以及空格外，其它字符全部被移除，全部由小写字母组成。需要返回所有locations（有<code>name</code>的<code>node</code>）的全名，前提是clean后的全名与<code>prefix</code>匹配。<br />复杂度要求<spanclass="math inline">\(O(k)\)</span>，k是共享同一前缀的所有地名。</p><p>比如这样：<br /><img src="6.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />除了自动补全，还需要完成Search功能：clean后的用户输入与clean后的<code>locationName</code>完全匹配，同名的<code>location</code>都需要加入<code>List</code>。<br />复杂度要求<spanclass="math inline">\(O(k)\)</span>，k是匹配的地名个数。<br />需要在<code>MapServer</code>类中实现<code>List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; getLocations(String locationName)</code>方法，返回同名的所有地方的信息，如果正确实现，那么就会有一个mark标记在那个地方：<br /><img src="7.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />具体实现一般用Trie，这里的难点在于输入是clean后的字符串，需要输出clean前的全名，所以我们的Trie结点除了有<code>children</code>和<code>isWord</code>外，还需要保存一些额外的信息（clean前的<code>name</code>/<code>id</code>/<code>lat</code>/<code>lon</code>），当然这些信息只有叶子结点才需要保存，用<code>List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; extraInfo</code>来存储。这样重名的地点虽然占用了相同的叶子，但是所有地点的信息都存在了该叶子的<code>extraInfo</code>当中，可以直接展示出来。</p><p>Debug好痛苦啊！！有一次怎么样在浏览器都渲染不出来，折腾了一天，最后发现是因为html文件里一个js文件要FQ才可以访问，醉了。</p><h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2><ul><li>Front-end Integration<br />现在是每调用一次，就在后台raster the entireimage，然后传到前端显示。实际中前端可以缓存用过的tiles以及路线，下次调用无需后台计算。</li><li>Vectored Tiles<br />现在的数据是一张张图片，实际上这些图片是可以从roads, lines, filledareas,buildings等基础矢量几何图形提取，可以用OpenGL/WebGL将其全部绘制为三角形，这样非常同一的工作就可以用GPU去做，速度比CPU要快很多，这些矢量图形可以在<ahref="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Vector_tiles">这里</a>下载。</li><li><ahref="https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2c/heroku">Deployon Heroku</a><br />目前为止，我们的地图还只能在本地运行，下来就将它部署到服务器~<br />具体的部署过程可以参考上述链接，完成后APP就会部署到<ahref="http://bearmaps-fun.herokuapp.com/map.html">这里</a>。<br />后续的代码更改需要rebuild jar包，然后redeploy。</li></ul><h2 id="todo">TODO</h2><p>做工程真是长期的活，遇到bug每天能写50行就不错了。</p><p>所有<ahref="https://github.com/EIMadrigal/CS61B/tree/master/proj3">代码</a>均已通过AG的测试：<br />Part I：<br /><img src="8.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />PART II &amp;

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>从小学作文开始，就喜欢写一些辞藻华丽的诗歌文章。<br />竹林七贤我当时只听说过山涛、阮籍和嵇康，引用之意是觉这几位遗世独立、傲然风骨，没有世俗羁绊，整日琴棋书画、饮酒作乐、不问世事，潇洒写意的生活，正是吾向往之。《广陵散》和《与山巨源绝交书》更是勾起了我对于嵇康无限的崇拜。<br />我极喜欢嵇康和纳兰性德，即使一些毫无关联的题目，也要用他们的事例强行去阐述论点。但由于只喜欢钻研近现代的战争史（可以原谅，男孩一般都喜欢枪支、火炮等近现代武器），一直对古代史不感兴趣，觉得几千年前的文化故事不过是落后、腐朽的代名词而已，所以其实对一些人物只是略知一二，最近花了些时间重新捋了一下魏晋那段历史，故分享于此。</p><h2 id="历史背景">历史背景</h2><p>我一直觉得想要真正了解一段文化、一个人物，就首先要了解他们所处的历史时代。<br />曹操在东汉末年的群雄逐鹿中“挟天子以令诸侯”，在三国末期势力最强。曹操去世后，其子曹丕于公元220年建立曹魏政权。公元265年，司马炎建立西晋，史称晋武帝。竹林七贤就是生活在这样一段历史时期：<br />山涛：205~283<br />阮籍：210~263<br />嵇康：224~263<br />刘伶：221~300<br />向秀：227~272<br />阮咸：不详<br />王戎：234~305<br />曹丕去世后，曹叡即位，公元239年隆冬时节，曹叡驾崩之际，将皇位传给仅仅8岁的曹芳，并将其同时托孤给司马懿和曹爽，于是在接下来漫长的几十年中，曹氏集团和司马氏集团开始了你死我活的政治斗争，史称“曹马之争”。</p><h2 id="竹林七贤">竹林七贤</h2><p>在那个极其黑暗动荡的乱世之中，文学和艺术却得到了出乎意料的大发展，人们对自由解放的追求达到了极致，鲁迅先生称之为魏晋风度。当时盛行清谈和隐逸，古人的心灵更加丰富和缠绵，规则的约束压抑了个性与自我，却在频频交流中迎来了文化的繁荣。不要用成王败寇的观点去评价历史人物，参差百态，实乃幸福本源。</p><p>而对魏晋风度影响最大的自然就是竹林七贤，虽然百年之后后人将其称之为七贤，但这个文人沙龙的规模其实大于7人，之所以定为七贤，据刘强老师的说法是为了攀附《论语》：</p><blockquote><p>贤者辟世，其次辟地，其次辟色，其次辟言。作者七人矣。</p></blockquote><p>另外，关于竹林七贤是否因为经常在竹林活动而得名也存疑。陈寅恪先生认为有可能是借佛经之中的“竹林精舍”的故事来表达出世的理想。据考证，他们的活动地点在都城洛阳以及山阳（今云台山）附近，后来当地可能为了借竹林七贤的名声促进旅游业的发展，所以人工栽种了一些竹林。</p><p>当时流行修身齐家治国平天下，但是这些才华横溢的文人开始却不愿做官，这是为什么呢？</p><p>“曹马之争”愈演愈烈，再加上这些名士的名气和影响力，他们被逼站队才能得以生存。那么问题来了，是站在司马家族一边，还是支持曹氏集团呢？曹爽此时被封为大将军，司马懿则是太尉，选择稍有不慎，很可能会被秋后算账。</p><p>作为老大哥，山涛最先受到“曹马之争”的冲击。</p><p>山涛早年丧父，出身庶族，隐居不仕，刘老师说可能是因为时机不成熟，2个政治集团的形势不明朗。山涛本人是有政治抱负的，但为了自保只能暂时推脱出仕邀请。</p><p>公元244年，他觉得形势明朗，自己的机会来了，终于在40岁时开始了官宦生涯，并且选择站到曹爽队伍里。</p><p>为了彻底击败曹氏集团，司马懿称病不朝，以退为进。极富政治头脑的山涛嗅出了不同的味道，突然醒悟，夜半弃官。</p><p>山涛弃官以后，司马懿在称病迷惑曹爽的同时，积累军事力量、联络曹魏老臣取得道义支持、散播舆论蛊惑人心，家族势力日渐强大。而就在此时，山涛结交了阮籍、嵇康等名士，整日醉饮玩乐。</p><p>公元249年，司马懿发动政变，一举粉碎了政敌曹爽集团，史称“高平陵之变”，以谋反罪处死了曹氏整个家族，数千人惨死，竹林七贤也受到了惊吓。接着为了缓解白色恐怖的气氛，司马家族开始招贤纳士、笼络人心，竹林七贤自然也在招贤之列：</p><p>山涛由于和司马氏的姻亲关系，第二次做官便凭借亲戚的身份主动投靠司马师，从此以后官运亨通，步入了仕途的快车道。</p><p>相比之下，在音乐、诗赋方面才华横溢的阮籍就显得异常凄惨。</p><p>阮籍的背景十分复杂，他的父亲阮瑀是建安七子之一，和曹魏关系密切；同时他又是司马氏的亲戚。<br />被招纳时，由于害怕司马懿的屠刀，于是阮籍答应为官，做了一个闲职。但他尸位素餐，整日划水摸鱼，几乎没有作为。并且他和司马氏倡导的封建礼教格格不入（司马氏当时号召“以孝治天下”，公元258年左右，阮籍丧母，他公然违背礼法，在葬礼期间喝酒吃肉），生活得极其痛苦但又不想过早结束生命，所以只能寄托于司马懿的死亡。</p><p>司马懿死后，其子司马师又把阮籍召去做官。司马昭上台后，为了拉拢阮籍，想要将阮籍的女儿嫁给司马昭的儿子司马炎，阮籍只能用烂醉如泥来应付。天天这样也不是办法，他就主动求官，调往外地，金蝉脱壳之计，但很不幸，十天后又被司马昭看穿并召回幕府。从此慎言慎行、明哲保身、郁郁寡欢。</p><p>嵇康死后，阮籍抑郁而终，晚年被迫为司马昭写了一篇歌功颂德的《劝进文》，成为了人生的污点。</p><p>向秀跟嵇康关系最好，嵇康的死给他带去了巨大的阴影，后来为了自保也踏上了仕途。</p><p>王戎后来做了大官，却变得非常吝啬，跟年轻时候判若两人，但是他依然很重情谊。<br />阮咸后来被山涛举荐，但没有被任用。</p><p>刘伶据说是7人里最丑的，但是他的精神自我十分强大，整日烂醉如泥，在酒中放飞自我，晚景凄凉。代表作《酒德颂》，刘强老师说他是真正的行为艺术家hh。</p><h2 id="嵇康">嵇康</h2><p>嵇康出身普通，自幼颠沛流离。和曹操同乡，其妻子是曹操的曾孙女长乐亭主，嵇康最后被司马昭所杀可能与这个因素也有关系。诗歌、文章、书法、乐理造诣很高，据传还是个大帅哥，史书记载：</p><blockquote><p>嵇康为人，肃肃如松下风，酒醉时倾倒，若玉山之将崩。</p></blockquote><p>他提出越名教任自然，反对礼教，追求自然和本我，厌恶政治斗争，据传嵇康在打铁时，司马氏的走狗钟会前来探访，所谓道不同不相与谋，故意把钟会晾在一边不说，走前还冷嘲热讽了一通。</p><p>当时司马师废掉了曹芳，引起淮南兵变，嵇康也想起兵响应，被山涛劝阻。</p><p>公元255年，司马师在平定叛乱时，由于得病死掉了。随后司马昭上台，希望招纳嵇康，嵇康借口避地河东。</p><p>嵇康以宽厚待人，虽然他的哥哥嵇喜还有几个朋友做了司马氏的官，但仍然没有影响他们的友谊。对待朋友友好，但是对待敌人却像严冬一样冷峻无情，也导致了后来悲剧的发生。</p><p>后来他又多次拒绝司马昭的邀请，但很不幸，嵇康最终还是卷进了政治斗争：<br />皇帝曹髦一直被司马昭操控，被迫封其为相国，眼看分分钟就要被取代的节奏。后来也由此诞生一个成语：司马昭之心——路人皆知。公元260年，曹髦很快就被司马昭干掉了，又找了一个傀儡。</p><p>公元261年，山涛升迁，找到嵇康希望他代替自己之前的官职。两人虽然“契若金兰”，但嵇康依然愤怒地写下《与山巨源绝交书》，极尽讽刺羞辱山涛，他觉得山涛拉拢他是为了缓解自己的尴尬，一起下水就不觉得那么罪过了。嵇康在书里自明心志：自己生性疏懒，阐述了自己做官的七不堪、二不可：<br />没法睡懒觉；喜欢休闲弹琴，出去玩不自由；需要正襟危坐；不喜欢写公务信；不喜欢吊丧；不喜欢和俗人共事；性情不耐烦，不喜欢做繁琐的事情。<br />菲薄古代的圣贤，被发现就挂了；性格刚烈、嫉恶如仇，沉不住气，不适合做官。</p><p>历史上关于两人是否真的绝交有争论：尤其是后来还发生了托孤事件。</p><p>屋漏偏逢连夜雨，接下来又发生了吕安事件，直接将嵇康送入了火坑之中：</p><p>吕巽是吕安的哥哥，对吕安的妻子有非分之想并且给他带了绿帽子，吕安告诉了嵇康，嵇康严词谴责了吕巽，但为了声誉，劝吕安隐忍不发，事情就这样被捂了下来。</p><p>吕巽和钟会关系很好，为了报复吕安，他向钟会进献谗言，钟会很可能为了牵出嵇康，以报一箭之仇，不久后就抓了吕安。嵇康听到消息后十分愤怒，写了一封《与吕长悌绝交书》，之后只身前往洛阳，去为吕安辩护。</p><p>吕安在流放途中，给嵇康写了一封言辞激烈的信。大意是说天下大乱，自己承受冤屈，他要改天换地。这封信很快落到了钟会手上，钟会终于等到了机会。</p><p>吕安事件由此升级为谋反罪，嵇康被当作同犯抓了。司马昭本来就忌惮嵇康，对他的不合作态度怀恨在心，但对于是否要杀嵇康也犹豫不决，此时钟会又站了出来上纲上线，说嵇康上不臣天子，下不事王侯，私下又罗织了几个理由：他说嵇康是人中龙凤，并且当年有起兵谋反之意。</p><p>欲加之罪，何患无辞？于是吕安和嵇康被关入死囚牢房，等待秋后问斩。</p><p>命犯小人，嵇康入狱后，有几千太学生为他抱打不平。他也在狱中反思自己，写下了《幽愤诗》，觉得自己虽然心地善良，但却没有识别坏人的能力。</p><p>临死前将其儿子嵇绍托付给山涛，有人说这是为了缓解山涛的愧疚之意，山涛接受了嵇康的托孤，把嵇绍培养的很好：</p><blockquote><p>巨源在，汝不孤矣！</p></blockquote><p>就在行刑前，太学生又请愿释放嵇康当太学老师。司马昭看到嵇康如此的影响力，杀心更重：<br />公元263年，嵇康与吕安一起在都城洛阳被处死。</p><p>据记载，行刑那天人山人海，嵇康顾看日影、神色坦然。</p><p>嵇康找哥哥嵇喜要了一把琴，嵇喜果然随身携带，而且嵇康的弹奏要求竟然被同意：<br />在刑场上，他平静呼吸，调整琴弦，弹完了最后的哀歌《广陵散》后说到：当年有一个朋友袁孝尼求学此散，自己由于吝惜，没有教给他：</p><blockquote><p>广陵散于今绝矣！</p></blockquote><h2 id="reference">Reference</h2><p>同济大学的刘强老师是魏晋史的专家，百家讲坛和上海图书馆系列讲座中都收录了他的精彩分享：<br /><ahref="http://tv.cctv.com/lm/bjjt/index.shtml#&amp;Type=0&amp;Y=2010&amp;M=10">百家讲坛之竹林七贤</a><br /><ahref="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Zt411d7Fr">竹林七贤与魏晋风度</a></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>WebProxy是浏览器和服务器的中间人：浏览器访问网页时，将请求发给代理，由代理将该请求发给服务器；服务器返回结果时，先发送给代理，由代理发给浏览器。之所以这么做，是因为可以在Proxy这做一些事情：</p><ul><li>防火墙: 比如伟大的GFW, 访问国外服务器必须先被GFW的代理审查一波</li><li>匿名器：代理可以隐藏浏览器的信息，使其对服务器匿名；</li><li>缓存：暂存服务器返回结果，加快访问速度。</li></ul><p>本项目要实现一个简单的Web Proxy，支持以下Features：</p><ul><li>中间人功能</li><li>并发</li><li>缓存</li></ul><h2 id="background-knowledge">Background Knowledge</h2><ul><li>HTTP/1.0 GET<br />当用户在浏览器输入URL<code>http://www.cnblogs.com/EIMadrigal</code>并按下回车后，浏览器会向代理发送HTTP请求，请求行可能如下：<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">GET http://www.cnblogs.com:8080/EIMadrigal HTTP/1.1</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>代理要将这个请求解析为主机名<code>www.cnblogs.com</code>、端口<code>8080</code>和路径<code>/EIMadrigal</code>，之后代理可以尝试连接<code>www.cnblogs.com</code>并且向服务器发送新的HTTP请求，请求行如下：<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">GET /EIMadrigal HTTP/1.0</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></li><li>Request Header <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200726153711559.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />请求头可能有多行，每行的基本组成就是头部字段名和值，需要注意的是：HTTP请求的每一行都以<code>\r\n</code>结束，并且整个请求是以空行<code>\r\n</code>结束。<br />项目要求：<strong>对于浏览器自带的requestheader，代理应该原封不动地转发</strong>。但必须将以下4项补齐，即如果自带的请求头包含以下4项之一，就按照自带请求头转发；否则按照下面的默认值转发。对于自带的其它请求头，直接转发即可：</li></ul><p>Host：服务器主机名，如果浏览器自带，直接转发；否则使用请求行里解析出的hostname。<br />User-Agent：用户的操作系统/浏览器等信息。<br />Connection：第一次请求/响应完成后，当前连接是否keep alive。<br />Proxy-Connection：同上。 <figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Host: www.cnblogs.com</span><br><span class="line">User-Agent: Mozilla/<span class="number">5.0</span> (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:<span class="number">10.0</span><span class="number">.3</span>) Gecko/<span class="number">20120305</span> Firefox/<span class="number">10.0</span><span class="number">.3</span></span><br><span class="line">Connection: close</span><br><span class="line">Proxy-Connection: close</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><ul><li>端口<br />请求端口：URL中的可选字段，如果用户输入时指定，代理应该连接指定端口，否则使用默认端口80。<br />监听端口：代理应该在该端口监听用户的连接请求，由命令行参数给出。可以是1024~65536之间的未被其他进程占用的任意值。</li></ul><h2 id="sequential-web-proxy">Sequential Web Proxy</h2><p>代理首先要接收浏览器HTTP请求，将浏览器的标准请求解析，转换为自己的请求发送。<br />这里的实现不难，只要模仿TinyServer在一个死循环中监听来自浏览器的请求，接收之后在<code>void doit(int fd)</code>里完成解析请求行、请求头、将处理后的请求发送给server、接收server的响应并写回浏览器。<br />一些比较方便的函数：<br /><code>int accept(int listenfd, struct sockaddr *addr, int *addrlen)</code>：在<code>listenfd</code>等待连接请求，将client的socket信息和长度存入<code>addr</code>和<code>addrlen</code>；<br /><code>int Open_clientfd(char *hostname, char *port)</code>：Openconnection to server at &lt;hostname, port&gt;, return a socketdescriptor ready for reading and writing.<br />读写时可以使用提供的RIO包。</p><p>这里需要注意的是请求的解析：思路是在proxy这里整合所有的请求行和请求头信息，对于所有浏览器发来的请求头的内容，原封不动保存到<code>reqHeader</code>里；对于默认的4个请求头，缺少几个，就按照规定内容增加进去。<br />还要注意：因为规定<code>Connection</code>和<code>Proxy-Connection</code>都有Connection这个单词，所以用<code>strstr</code>查找的时候：如果浏览器自带的请求头没有<code>Connection</code>但是有<code>Proxy-Connection</code>，这时程序就可能误判为有<code>Connection</code>，所以最好用函数<code>strncmp</code>或者<code>memcmp</code>。</p><p>要写一个非常robust的URI解析器还是挺繁琐的，由于C没有正则表达式（也许可以用其他语言写好编译成库，然后C程序调用？），需要考虑的情况很多。<br />首先明确URI的格式：一般由4部分组成：protocol://hostname:[port]/path/[parameters][?query][#fragment]<br />协议目前只支持HTTP和HTTPS，其它一律不合法。<br />因为一旦和服务器建立连接后，protocol和hostname就没用了，只需要path以及后面的query和fragment，为了方便起见，将/也放入path字段，因为其表示根目录，但是对于query和fragment，没有放?和#，因为找到请求内容的位置后，一些具体的搜索/片段直接用关键字即可，与?和#没关系，只有/特殊一些。</p><h2 id="multiple-concurrent-requests">Multiple Concurrent Requests</h2><p>对于Iterative Server，同时只能处理一个连接请求：<imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200821122702755.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />当第二个客户试图去连接：调用<code>connect</code>会正常返回，但Server不会<code>Accept</code>该请求，会用TCPListenBacklog技术将该请求入队；调用<code>rio_writen</code>也会正常返回，Server会把写入的数据存入缓存；调用<code>rio_readlineb</code>会阻塞，因为Server没有发送任何的response。</p><p>解决方法就是并发处理，我们的代理要能同时处理多个请求，具体的方法很多：多进程、I/O多路复用、预线程化（类似生产者-消费者问题，先创建n个线程，相当于n个缓冲区），最直接的方式就是专门有一个线程负责监听，每收到一个连接请求，就开一个新线程去进行读写。这里要采用<strong>可分离</strong>的线程模型：当其终止时，内存资源会被系统自动回收。</p><p>这部分本来很简单，但是写完后测试发现挂了： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200811181713826.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />这很可能是NOP Server出了问题，这个Server是用Python写的，我去启动了一下：<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">./nop-server.py <span class="number">15000</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure> 发现： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200811182155577.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />这个问题是Python的版本不匹配，把<code>nop-server.py</code>第一行的<code>#!/usr/bin/python</code>改为<code>#!/usr/bin/python3</code>即可，指定用python3的解释器执行脚本。</p><p>并发这块也妥了： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200811182851976.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />这里的测试逻辑是这样的：Client1通过proxy连接到nop-server，这个服务器永远不会发送response，也就是这条连接一直保持；Client2通过proxy连接到Tiny，看看能不能从Tiny取个文件回来，如果能，说明并发是ok的，如果不能，说明不支持并发。之所以要用nop-server，是因为这东西可以一直连接，比较方便。如果Client1也是通过proxy连Tiny，那么可能很快就执行完了，这时Client2再去连接，很可能就不是并发的访问了，失去了测试的意义。</p><p>做第三部分之前，先实际测试下proxy的健壮性。用FireFox浏览器试试，先升级到最新版本，然后设置浏览器的代理方式：<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200811194820393.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />在8080端口运行proxy，然后找个HTTP网站<code>http://csrankings.org/</code>试一下，现在网站基本都是HTTPS，看来后续的Features要支持HTTPS了（先挖个坑）。</p><p>运行proxy之前，画风是这样的： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200811200533477.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> 运行proxy之后： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200821133459152.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />通过代理访问该网页时，页面只能加载一部分，收到59420B数据后，会<code>segmentation fault</code>，最后发现主要原因是<code>init_cache()</code>时空间分配写错了，但是修改后又出现了如下错误：<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200824160910224.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />是<code>memcpy</code>时候数组越界，处理buffer时候要千万小心。</p><p>这里要改下<code>csapp.c</code>中的错误处理，里面都是直接<code>exit(0)</code>，但是作为一个服务器，不能随便终止，所以我们注释掉所有Error-handlingfunctions里的<code>exit()</code>，如果在读数据或者什么时候遇到错误，<code>return</code>即可：<code>exit()</code>是系统调用级别的，结束整个进程；<code>return</code>是函数级别的，返回给调用者，当然在<code>main()</code>里<code>return</code>也就是<code>exit(0)</code>。</p><h2 id="caching-web-objects">Caching Web Objects</h2><p>HTTP协议本身就实现了缓存机制, 目的是为了减小网络传输的开销,只需要通过URI和请求端口就可以判断是否请求的同一对象.缓存可以说是整个项目的难点, 需要考虑的问题比较多.为了模块化，将这一部分单独写作<code>cache.c/cache.h</code>,并修改<code>Makefile</code>.</p><p>首先, 由于内存有限,因此代理的缓存大小<code>MAX_CACHE_SIZE</code>也是有限的. 另外,为了避免太大的web对象占据太多缓存空间, 减小其他对象的被缓存几率,对web对象的大小<code>MAX_OBJECT_SIZE</code>也是有要求的.</p><p>难点有2个：</p><ol type="1"><li>多线程同步：对于cache的访问应当是线程安全的，多个线程可以同时读，但只有一个线程可以写，这就是典型的读者-写者问题;<br /></li><li>替换策略：cache块的数量是有限的，没有空间时就需要换出换入。一般来讲都是采用LRU方式，一个单线程的严格的LRUCache可以参考<ahref="https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/">leetcode146题</a>。</li></ol><p>我们首先来解决问题一:保证线程安全最简单的方法就是给<strong>整个cache</strong>加一个大大的排他锁(exclusivelock), 效率当然会低到无法接受. 一个直观的改进就是将cache分区,细化锁的粒度, 用读写锁进行保护.<br />读者写者问题可以有读优先和写优先2种方案: 读优先指来了一个读进程,除非有一个写进程正在访问, 否则读者直接去读, 可能导致写进程饥饿.写优先指有进程读时, 如果来了写进程, 那么禁止后续读进程请求,现有进程读完后, 写进程立即去写, 可能导致读进程饥饿.<br />写优先实现起来稍微麻烦一些, 并且一般读操作频率高于写操作,所以这里采用读优先. 这里就不自己实现读者写者了,使用读写锁<code>pthread_rwlock_t</code>, 确保不会死锁.</p><p>接着来解决问题二: 要实现多线程并发LRUCache，由于C实现双向链表和Hashtable有点繁琐，所以项目要求<strong>近似LRU</strong>即可：我们可以为每一个cache块附加一个时间戳，每当该块被访问时，就更新时间戳。需要替换时，换出时间戳最小的块即可。这样带来的问题就是：读的时候也需要更新时间戳，但更新时间需要加写锁，如果其他线程占用写锁，那么读进程就无法更新时间戳，也就不是严格的LRU了。</p><p>Cache的实现既可以像malloclab一样采用分级的思想，也可以直接均分所有空间，整体流程如下：</p><ul><li>初始化</li><li>查Cache</li><li>如果miss，寻找可用位置</li><li>找到可用块，缓存满足大小条件的Object</li><li>更新时间戳</li></ul><p>最大的缓存对象是100KB，一共的空间1MB，平均可以缓存10个Object，这样大的对象占用太多空间，降低cache命中率，所以采用分级的方法：<br />100KB * 5块 = 500KB<br />50KB * 6块 = 300KB<br />20KB * 5块 = 100KB<br />10KB * 10块 = 100KB<br />1KB * 24块 = 24KB<br />接着来构思下存储结构，<strong>设计数据结构</strong>和<strong>类（函数）接口</strong>是我认为做一个工程最难的部分，当然还有最后的效率优化问题：<br />一个cacheline最基本的构成需要存储URI和OBJ，因为下次用户请求时代理需要知道请求的是哪个网站的什么内容（通过URI确定），进而如果查找到，将内容OBJ直接返回给用户。同时还需要一个时间戳以及用于同步的读写锁：<figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">struct</span> &#123;</span></span><br><span

objSize;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">int64_t</span> time;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">pthread_rwlock_t</span> rwlock; </span><br><span class="line">&#125; cache_line;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>一共有5种类型的cache，每种类型有一个number，还有一个指向该种cache第一块的指针p，p指向该种的第一小块，p+1指向该种的第二小块，以此类推：<figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">struct</span> &#123;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">int</span> numOfLine;</span><br><span class="line">    cache_line *cachep;</span><br><span class="line">&#125; cache_type;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>数据结构设计完后，需要设计函数接口，cache的操作有初始化、查找、写入（替换）和释放：<br />初始化需要为cacheblock分配空间，将每一块的时间戳置0，表示该块没有存储内容；<br />查找时需要遍历所有的type，再在该type中遍历所有的block，如果时间戳不为0，比对浏览器需要访问的URI与当前块的URI是否相等，相等则表示cachehit，直接写回给相应的fd；更新时间戳时，粒度越细越好，这里用<code>gettimeofday</code>精确到微秒级别；读取时如果能申请到写锁，就更新时间，否则就不更新；<br />写入时需要先计算object大小，寻找空闲的cacheblock，没有需要替换，满足要求后存入cache，并且将结果返给浏览器。这里要注意寻找空闲块时要<strong>从小往大</strong>，否则很可能一个很小的object占用了一块很大的block，造成严重浪费，类似于操作系统内存管理动态分配中的最佳适应算法。<br />那么这种分级的方式的缺点是：每种类型的cache块<strong>大小固定</strong>，很可能50KB的块只存了10KB内容，造成浪费，类似于固定分区分配。<br />关于替换，我们采取<strong>局部置换</strong>策略：即需要换入的object大小如果是30KB，我们只用50KB这种类型去存储，如果50KB的块用完了，就需要换出一块50KB，即使此时100KB的块有空闲，也仍然完成置换过程。</p><p>写完cache后，需要修改<code>Makefile</code>，在<code>proxy.c</code>中增加cache的部分。运行完以后，可以用<code>make clean</code>清除目录下多余的垃圾文件，比如<code>.o</code>文件等。</p><h2 id="test">Test</h2><p>测试的方式一共有3种：</p><ul><li>自动化测试利用课程提供的脚本<code>driver.sh</code>自动进行，执行之前，需要安装一些工具：<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo apt-get install net-tools</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>做完所有内容后，先用<code>driver.sh</code>进行测试，发现cache部分没分。。。得，开始debug吧！我觉得GDB好难用啊，所以都是通过<code>printf</code>de的。</li></ul><p>用curl先通过proxy发个请求，然后看看proxy有没有缓存服务器返回的内容。<br />最后发现在<code>write_cache</code>时需要用到URI，但是之前解析时候把URI改了，一定注意URI最好不要改，设置为<code>const</code>比较保险。</p><p>完了以后，cache满分了，basic又错了一个，fetch可执行对象文件tiny时：<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200819212506210.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />一开始怀疑是tiny太大了，某个数组爆掉了。看了下tiny有36000+B，缓存空间足够，但是可能写入时候有些bug。tiny是二进制文件，可能比较特殊？很奇怪的是：明明<code>objSize</code>是36000+，但是<code>strlen(obj)</code>只有100，怀疑文件中可能有<code>\0</code>，提前终止了<code>strlen</code>的计数。</p><p>解决方案是<code>write_cache</code>参数不仅要有<code>uri</code>和<code>obj</code>，还要有<code>obj</code>的长度<code>len</code>，否则直接用<code>strlen</code>获取长度可能就挂了。后来修改以后就满分了，一定要注意，如果用<code>char*</code>传参，一定要附带参数<code>len</code>，因为不一定读取的是字符串，还有可能是二进制文件，<code>\0</code>也就是<code>0</code>很容易出现，用<code>strlen</code>大概率会爆掉。</p><p>最终测试结果如下： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200819221810760.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200819221846500.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> - 利用<code>curl</code>工具<br /><code>curl</code>可以用来生成HTTP请求：假设Sever在端口15213监听，代理在端口15214监听，那么可以通过下面命令经由代理发送请求：<figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">curl -v --proxy http:<span class="comment">//localhost:15214 http://localhost:15213/home.html</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure> 我们用该工具测试下Sequential Web Proxy：<br />首先启动Tiny Web Server和Proxy： <figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">./tiny 15213</span><br><span class="line">./proxy 15214</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>然后执行<code>curl</code>命令： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200730162654329.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />说明基本功能是OK的！！ - 实际浏览器测试<br />满分之后，万里长征走了一半吧，因为要在实际浏览器测试，不断增强程序的<strong>鲁棒性</strong>。测试之前，先禁用浏览器自带的cache，清空之前的缓存。 测下内存泄漏：</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">valgrind --leak-check=full

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>读诗之前，先澄清一点：这首诗原作者是作家张梅女士，收录于20世纪90年代出版的个人散文集《木屐声声》。至于流传甚广的余光中先生的《写给未来的你》，完全是某些出版物杜撰的，17年余先生去世时，大家读着这篇别人的文章以为纪念，不知道算不算一种悲哀。</p><p>如果读过余光中的作品，他的文风绝对不会像这首诗这么直白，当然也不会如此鸡汤。</p><p>说回这首诗，有一次搜索「理想主义者」时偶然读到，虽然有些道理比较宏大，但是整体来看都是作者阅历的总结，如果结合自身经验去读相信一定收获颇丰，当然作为育儿经也是不错的~</p><hr /><p>孩子，我希望你自始至终都是一个理想主义者。</p><p>你可以是农民，可以是工程师，可以是演员，可以是流浪汉，但你必须是个理想主义者。</p><p>童年，我们讲英雄故事给你听，并不是一定要你成为英雄，而是希望你具有纯正的品格。</p><p>少年，我们让你接触诗歌、绘画、音乐，是为了让你的心灵填满高尚的情趣。这些高尚的情趣会支撑你的一生，使你在最严酷的冬天也不会忘记玫瑰的芳香。</p><p>理想会使人出众。</p><p>孩子，不要为自己的外形担忧。</p><p>理想纯洁你的气质，而最美貌的女人也会因为庸俗而令人生厌。</p><p>通向理想的途径往往不尽如人意，而你亦会为此受尽磨难。</p><p>但是，孩子，你尽管去争取，理想主义者的结局悲壮而绝不可怜。</p><p>在貌似坎坷的人生里，你会结识许多智者和君子，你会见到许多旁人无法遇到的风景和奇迹。</p><p>选择平庸虽然稳妥，但绝无色彩。</p><p>不要为蝇头小利放弃自己的理想，不要为某种潮流而改换自己的信念。</p><p>物质世界的外表太过复杂，你要懂得如何去拒绝虚荣的诱惑。</p><p>理想不是实惠的东西，它往往不能带给你尘世的享受。</p><p>因此你必须习惯无人欣赏，学会精神享受，学会与他人不同。</p><p>其次，孩子，我希望你是个踏实的人。</p><p>人生太过短促，而虚的东西又太多，你很容易眼花缭乱，最终一事无成。</p><p>如果你是个美貌的女孩，年轻的时候会有许多男性宠你，你得到的东西太过容易，这会使你流于浅薄和虚浮；如果你是个极聪明的男孩，又会以为自己能够成就许多大事而流于轻佻。</p><p>记住，每个人的能力有限，我们活在世上能做好一件事足矣。</p><p>写好一本书，做好一个主妇。</p><p>不要轻视平凡的人，不要投机取巧，不要攻击自己做不到的事。</p><p>你长大后会知道，做好一件事太难，但绝不要放弃。</p><p>你要懂得和珍惜感情。</p><p>不管男人女人，不管墙内墙外，相交一场实在不易。</p><p>交友的过程会有误会和摩擦，但想一想，诺大世界，有缘结伴而行的能有几人？</p><p>你要明白朋友终会离去，生活中能有人伴在身边，听你倾谈，倾谈给你听，就应该感激。</p><p>要爱自己和爱他人，要懂自己和懂他人。</p><p>你的心要如溪水般柔软，你的眼波要像春天般明媚。</p><p>你要会流泪，会孤身一人坐在黑暗中听伤感的音乐。</p><p>你要懂得欣赏悲剧，悲剧能丰富你的心灵。</p><p>希望你不要媚俗。</p><p>你是个独立的人，无人能抹杀你的独立性，除非你向世俗妥协。</p><p>要学会欣赏真，要在重重面具下看到真。</p><p>世上圆滑标准的人很多，但出类拔萃的人极少。而往往出类拔萃又隐藏在卑琐狂荡之下。</p><p>在形式上我们无法与既定的世俗争斗，而在内心我们都是自己的国王。</p><p>如果你的脸上出现谄媚的笑容，我将会羞愧地掩面而去。</p><p>世俗的许多东西虽耀眼却无价值，不要把自己置于大众的天平上，不然你会因此无所适从，人云亦云。</p><p>在具体的做人上，我希望你不要打断别人的谈话，不要娇气十足。</p><p>你每天至少要拿出两小时来读书，要回信写信给你的朋友。</p><p>不要老是想着别人应该为你做些什么，而要想着怎么去帮助他人。</p><p>借他人的东西要还，不要随便接受别人的恩惠。</p><p>要记住，别人的东西，再好也是别人的；自己的东西，再差也是自己的。</p><p>孩子，还有一件事，虽然做起来很难，但相当重要，这就是要有勇气正视自己的缺点。</p><p>你会一年年地长大，会渐渐遇到比你强、比你优秀的人，会发现自己身上有许多你所厌恶的缺点。这会使你沮丧和自卑。</p><p>但你一定要正视它，不要躲避，要一点点地加以改正。</p><p>战胜自己比征服他人还要艰巨和有意义。</p><p>不管世界潮流如何变化，但人的优秀品质却是永恒的：正直、勇敢、独立。</p><p>我希望你是一个优秀的人。</p>]]></content>

      <title>Seam Carving</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>这是CS 61B的HW5，具体实现<ahref="https://github.com/EIMadrigal/CS61B/tree/master/hw5">在这里</a>。## Intro 这个项目是要实现一种基于内容的图像缩放算法SeamCarving。Seam分为垂直（自上而下每行取一个像素点）和水平（自左向右每列取一个像素点）。<br />下图是一张505*287的图像：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200707090755919.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />移除150条垂直seam，得到一张比原图窄30%的新图：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2020070709085251.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />与传统的内容不可知的方法（裁剪、缩放）相比，seamcurving可以保留原图的大多数重要特征。<br />图像处理中的坐标表示与常见的笛卡尔坐标系不同：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200707094310172.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />每个像素的颜色采用RGB空间，与<code>java.awt.Color</code>一致。算法的过程分为3步：</p><ul><li>Energy calculation<br />因为是内容感知算法，所以需要一个指标衡量每个像素的<strong>重要程度</strong>，这个指标我们叫做该像素点的能量：能量越高越重要，就不太会被当做seam的一部分剔除。<br />我们选择双梯度能量函数来计算能量。对于上面的冲浪图，计算后的灰度图如下：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200707095021383.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />可以看到：高能量像素对应颜色发生巨变的地方，比如冲浪者和大海的边界、天际线等，并且颜色更白。处理过程中就是要避免移除这些关键信息。</li><li>Seam identification<br />计算出每个像素点的能量值后，就要找出一条能量值总和最小的seam，垂直seam从顶行的某像素点开始到最后一行某点结束。但是如果(x,y)位于seam，下一行只能选(x-1,y+1),(x,y+1), (x+1,y+1)之一，可能是为了保证图像的连贯。</li><li>Seam Removal<br />移除找到的seam。</li></ul><h2 id="implement">Implement</h2><p>三个步骤的实现都在<code>SeamCarver</code>中，我们逐个来看： -单像素能量计算<br />采用对偶梯度能量函数<span class="math inline">\(\Delta_x^2(x, y) +\Delta_y^2(x, y)\)</span>，x梯度的平方<spanclass="math inline">\(\Delta_x^2(x, y) = R_x(x, y)^2 + G_x(x, y)^2 +B_x(x, y)^2\)</span>，<span class="math inline">\(R_x(x, y), G_x(x, y),B_x(x, y)\)</span>是左右两个像素点(x+1, y)和(x-1,y)的红、绿、蓝之差的绝对值；类似地，对于y的梯度，就是要求上下两个像素点的差。对于边界的处理，采取循环方式，即如果某侧不存在，就取反方向的点。<br />举例来看： <img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200707155708977.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />要计算(1, 0)位置即(255, 101, 153)的能量：<br /><span class="math display">\[R_x(1, 0) = 255 − 255 = 0, G_x(1, 0) = 101− 101 = 0, B_x(1, 0) = 255 − 51 = 204\]</span><br />故<span class="math inline">\(\Delta_x^2(1, 0) = 204^2 =41616\)</span>；对于y方向，由于没有(x, y-1)，就用(x,height-1)代替：<br /><span class="math display">\[R_y(1, 0) = 255 − 255 = 0, G_y(1, 0) = 255− 153 = 102, B_y(1, 0) = 153 − 153 = 0\]</span><br />故<span class="math inline">\(\Delta_y^2(1, 0) = 102^2 =10404\)</span>，所以(1, 0)位置的能量就是<spanclass="math inline">\(41616 + 10404 = 52020\)</span>。<br />接口也很简单<code>public  double energy(int x, int y)</code>。 - FindVertical Seam<br />这个接口设计为<code>public int[] findVerticalSeam()</code>，返回的数组有H个值，第i个值对应要移除的第i行的列号。<br />要找这样一条最短路径，我们考虑用动态规划求解：<br />首先定义子问题<span class="math inline">\(M(i,j)\)</span>表示以<spanclass="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span>结尾的最短路径的成本，用<spanclass="math inline">\(e(i,j)\)</span>表示位置<spanclass="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span>的能量；<br />接着寻找状态转移方程：由于路径的左右位置绝对值不大于1，所以<spanclass="math inline">\(M(i,j)=e(i,j)+min\{M(i-1,j-1),M(i,j-1),M(i+1,j-1)\}\)</span>；<br />最后确定base case：每行的值都由上一行确定，所以base case就是<spanclass="math inline">\(M(i,0)=e(i,0)\)</span>。<br />最终结果就是在最后一行找到<spanclass="math inline">\(M\)</span>最小的像素点，逐行向上寻找三个相邻格子中<spanclass="math inline">\(M\)</span>较小的那个。 - Find HorizontalSeam<br />对于水平方向的seam，当然也可以用动态规划求解。但是为了避免代码冗余，我们考虑利用<code>findVerticalSeam()</code>：先将图像转置，然后调用<code>findVerticalSeam()</code>，最后再将其转置即可。<br />具体的：考虑如下3*2图像：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200708090038977.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />将其转置：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2020070809031641.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />利用<code>findVerticalSeam()</code>得到(0,1,0)即为水平的seam，最后将图像再次转置即可。</p><h2 id="待改进">待改进</h2><ul><li>能量计算<br />每次移除一条seam，都要调用<code>findVerticalSeam()</code>，<code>findVerticalSeam()</code>中会计算所有格子的能量，这样如果我们移除20条seam，就要计算20次所有格子的能量，显然这是可以避免的。<br />最直观的方法就是空间换时间，创建能量矩阵<code>double[][]</code>存储每个格子的能量。</li><li>水平seam<br />转置矩阵耗时<spanclass="math inline">\(O(WH)\)</span>，更快一些的做法是利用一个flag记录当前是在寻找垂直还是水平seam，在计算能量时判断分类。</li></ul><h2 id="reference">Reference</h2><p><a href="https://sp18.datastructur.es/materials/hw/hw5/hw5">HW 5:Seam Carving</a></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>三毛的书我读的不多，大概只有《撒哈拉的故事》、《梦里花落知多少》和《谈心》。<br />初识三毛，是在《谈心》中她给一个读者的回信：</p><blockquote><p>三毛女士：<br />我今年廿九岁，未婚，是一家报关行最低层的办事员，常常在我下班以后，回到租来的斗室里，面对物质和精神都相当贫乏的人生，觉得活着的价值，十分...对不起，我黯淡的心情，无法用文字来表达。我很自卑，请你告诉我，生命最终的目的何在？<br />以我如此卑微的人（我的容貌太平凡了），工作能力也有限，说不出有什么特别的兴趣，也从来没有异性对我感兴趣。<br />我真羡慕你，恨不得能够活得像你，可惜我不能，请你多写书给我看，丰富我的生命，不然，真不知活着还有什么快乐？<br />敬祝<br />春安！<br />一个不快乐的女孩上</p></blockquote><p>谈及生命的意义，这或许是大多数人都会思考的问题，然而它却不像数学题那样有什么所谓的标准答案，这是一道拥有无数种解法的题目。丝毫不需要掩饰，直至今日我仍然没有完全明晰。<br />是的，人终有一死，一切都会湮灭。生活中的很多事情从人生这一宏观角度来看根本不值一提，广而泛之，其实所有的事情都不值一提。那么生命的意义到底在哪里？不妨先了解下三毛的想法：</p><blockquote><p>不快乐的女孩：<br />从你短短的自我介绍中，看来十分惊心，二十九岁正当年轻，居然一连串的用了——最低层、贫乏、黯淡、自卑、平凡、卑微、能力有限这许多不正确的定义来形容自己。<br />以我个人的经验来说，我也反复思索过许多次，生命的意义和最终目的到底是什么，目前我的答案却只有一个，很简单的一个，那便是“<strong>寻求真正的自由</strong>”，然后<strong>享受生命</strong>。<br />不快乐的女孩，你的心灵并不自由，对不对？当然，我也没有做到绝对的超越，可是如你信中所写的那些字句，我已不再用在自己身上了，虽然我们比较起来是差不多的。<br />如果我是你，第一步要做的事是加重对自我的期许与看重，将信中那一串又一串自卑的字句从生命中一把扫除，再也不轻看自己。<br />你有一个正当的职业，租得起一间房间，容貌不差，懂得在上下班之余更进一步探索生命的意义，这都是很优美的事情，为何觉得自己卑微呢？你觉得卑微是因为没有用自己的主观眼光观看自己，而用了社会一般的功利主义的眼光，这是十分遗憾的。<br />一个不欣赏自己的人，是难以快乐的。<br />当然，由你的来信中，很容易想见你部分的心情，你表达的能力并不弱，由你的文字中，明明白白可以看见一个都市单身女子对于生命的无可奈何与悲哀，这种无可奈何，并不浮浅，是值得看重的。<br />很实际的来说，不谈空幻的方法，如果我住在你所谓的“斗室”里，如果是我，第一件会做的事情，就是布置我的房间。我会将房间粉刷成明朗的白色，给自己在窗上做上一幅美丽的窗帘，我在床头放一个普通的小收音机，在墙角做一个书架，给灯泡换一个温暖而温馨的灯罩，然后，我要去花市，仔细的挑几盆看了悦目的盆景，放在我的窗口。如果仍有余钱，我会去买几张名画的复制品——海报似的那种，将它挂在墙上……这么弄一下，以我的估价，是不会超过四千台币的，当然除了那架收音机之外，一切自己动手做，就省去了工匠费用，而且生活会有趣得多。<br />房间布置得美丽，是享受生命改变心情的第一步，在我来说，它不再是斗室了。然后，当我发薪水的时候——如果我是你，我要给自己用极少的钱，去买一件美丽又实用的衣服。如果我觉得心情不够开朗，我很可能去一家美发店，花一百台币修剪一下终年不变的发型，换一个样子，给自己耳目一新的快乐。我会在又发薪水的下一个月，为自己挑几样淡色的化妆品，或者再买一双新鞋。当然，薪水仍然是每个月会领的，下班后也有四五小时的空闲，那时候，我可能去青年会报名学学语文、插花或者其他感兴趣的课程，不要有压力的每周夜间上两次课，是改换环境又充实自己的另一个方式。<br />你看，如果我是你，我慢慢的在变了。<br />我去上上课，也许可能交到一些朋友，我的小房间既然那么美丽，那么也许偶尔可以请朋友来坐坐，谈谈各自的生活和梦想。<br />慢慢的，我不再那么自卑了，我勇于接触善良而有品德的人群（这种人在社会上仍有许多许多），我会发觉，原来大家都很平凡——可是优美，正如自己一样。我更会发觉，原来一个美丽的生活，并不需要太多的金钱便可以达到。我也不再计较异性对我感不感兴趣，因为我自己的生活一点一点的丰富起来，自得其乐都来不及，还想那么多吗？<br />如果我是你，我会不再等三毛出新书，我自己写札记，写给自己欣赏，我慢慢的会发觉，我自己写的东西也有风格和趣味，我真是一个可爱的女人。<br />不快乐的女孩子，请你要行动呀！不要依赖他人给你快乐。你先去将房间布置起来，勉强自己去做，会发觉事情没有你想象的那么难，而且，兴趣是可以寻求的，东试试西试试，只要心中认定喜欢的，便去培养它，成为下班之后的消遣。<br />可是，我仍觉得，<strong>在这个世界上，最深的快乐，是帮助他人，而不只是在自我的世界里享受</strong>——当然，享受自我的生命也是很重要的。你先将自己假想为他人，帮助自己建立起信心，下决心改变一下目前的生活方式，把自己弄得活泼起来，不要任凭生命再做赔本的流逝和伤感，起码你得试一下，尽力的去试一下，好不好？<br />享受生命的方法很多很多，问题是你一定要有行动，空想是不行的。下次给我写信的时候，署名快乐的女孩，将那个“不”字删掉了好吗？<br />你的朋友三毛上</p></blockquote><p>这篇回信给我最深印象的，就是<strong>在这个世界上，最深的快乐，是帮助他人，而不只是在自我的世界里享受</strong>。实话实说，我并没有那么高尚的境界，甚至以前很少想到这一层。不过非常幸运的是：关于寻求自由与享受生命，我与三毛达成了一致。有了思想的指导，方法自然不会成为障碍，信中提到的做法会带来改变。<br />好久前看过李健的一个访谈，他说在任何时代，自我价值的实现都是很重要的，过好自己的生活，成为生活的艺术家是最难的事情，但他一直在尝试。经常性地关注村上等人的生活状态，极度追求个人自由与价值的实现，但是忽视了thebig picture。当然村上自从《地下》以后，改变了很多。<br />这些对我个人价值观的塑造都有很大的影响（大概就是读书的好处吧），所以我一度认为生命没有意义，你做的一切，或者说人类做的一切，都没有意义。那么为什么还要去做事呢？是因为总得有事情去填充我们的时间。做好当下的事或者虚度时光，结果是迥然不同的，将来回忆起来很多事没有体验，岂不肠子都悔青了？<br />真理总是很早就学过，却很晚才明白：</p><blockquote><p>人最宝贵的是生命，生命对于每个人只有一次，这仅有的一次应当怎样度过？<br />每当回忆往事的时候，不因虚度年华而悔恨，不因碌碌无为而羞耻。</p></blockquote><p>前面说过，这是一道有着无数种解法的题目。每个个体想做的事很多，不过共同之处在于：doit，千万不要因为畏惧而放弃、拖延，当下只有一次，永不会再来。在认真体验、洒脱生活、享受酸甜苦辣的同时，记得帮助别人。<br />戏剧之处在于：如果读者只看过《撒哈拉的故事》，没人会接受三毛最终的选择。物质生活那样贫瘠的非洲，再加上常年患病的身体，都没有击垮她。相反，她将平凡的日子过得如诗一般，幸福早已溢出了文字，哪怕结婚用香菜代替鲜花她也津津乐道。就是这样一个善良自由、追求自我实现的人，荷西的死却成为她生命中无可挽回的拐点，也许浪漫的人很难有好的生活。再去看《梦里花落知多少》，你可能无法相信这出自同一个作家之手。<br />痛失挚爱，无异于晴天霹雳，但我想大多数人都会渐渐走出这份悲伤，只是时间长短不同罢了。感性的人很难自拔，会沉醉过去，也会幻想梦境：</p><blockquote><p>记得当时年纪小<br />你爱谈天<br />我爱笑<br />有一回并肩坐在桃树下<br />风在林梢鸟儿在叫<br />我们不知怎样睡着了<br />梦里花落知多少</p></blockquote><p>那种语调，并不是刻意地悲痛，好似一切都变淡了，当然也包括生死，三毛不断提醒自己要有责任心，还要照顾父母，如此目的很难维持得下去。<br />我们慨叹命运弄人，每一丝幸福，都可能是若干年后的一场悲剧，因为开始就会有结束。而且快乐往往是短暂的，就像它的字面意思一样，平淡和普通才是人生的主旋律。</p><hr /><ul class="task-list"><li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />不知怎么搞的，可能读书越来越少、手机越玩越多的缘故，也可能书单过于单一，总是看些小说滥竽充数，写一些人文类blog总是力不从心：不论是行文思路，还是写作手法，直到最后的自我表达都十分混乱，而且遣词造句多有贫瘠累赘之感，甚至还不如小时候来得自然和丰富。别无他法，只有大量阅读思考才可能改观，希望每天都能静下来读会书吧，先看看中国现代文学@-@</li></ul>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>垃圾回收：为了防止内存泄漏，对<strong>堆</strong>中死亡的对象进行清除，并回收相应空间的机制。<br />某些有GC机制的语言(Java,Python...)，平时不会特别在意内存的分配和释放。但是对于C/C++等语言来说，稍有不慎就会造成MemoryLeak/Double Frees/Use-after-frees等问题。</p><h2 id="garbage">Garbage</h2><p>垃圾顾名思义就是以后不再使用的对象。但是要确定一个对象是垃圾通常很难，所以我们认为不可达（没有被引用）对象就是垃圾，但是需要明确的是：许多可达对象也不再会使用，也是垃圾，但是这种垃圾我们无法回收，所以即使拥有GC机制的语言也很容易造成内存泄漏。</p><h2 id="reference-counting">Reference Counting</h2><p>C++的<code>shared_ptr</code>主要采用引用计数法，实现简单：<br />每个对象都与一个引用计数器<code>cnt</code>相关联，每当有一个引用指向该对象，<code>++cnt</code>；一个引用失效时，<code>--cnt</code>。当<code>cnt==0</code>时：Removeall outgoing references from that object，并且清理该对象。</p><p>由于每个<code>cnt</code>记录的是引用数，而不是可达的引用数，只关注自己的对象而没有全局的信息，<strong>循环引用</strong>的情况就无法被回收：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200705104719124.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /></p><h2 id="mark-sweep">Mark-Sweep</h2><p>Lua/Ruby等主要采用Mark-Sweep算法：<br />有一些位置是明确知道可达的：全局变量、栈中的变量以及寄存器中的变量等，这些区域作为rootset，从rootset出发可达的对象视为存活对象，不可达对象视为待回收对象。</p><ul><li>mark阶段目标是找到可达对象。<br />-- 将root set中的对象放入worklist；<br />-- 当worklist不空：<br />从worklist中移除一个对象；<br />如果该对象没有标记，标记它并且把从它出发的所有可达对象加入worklist。</li><li>sweep阶段目标是回收死亡对象。<br />-- 对于<strong>所有已经分配的对象</strong>：<br />如果未标记，释放；<br />如果已经标记，为了下一次的GC，unmark。</li></ul><p>有时候确实很难想象如此简洁的设计竟然是Lua5.0之前采用的机制，不过工程上一条重要的原则就是：<strong>先完成、再完善</strong>。这个比较简单的GC实现过程可以参考<ahref="http://it.deepinmind.com/gc/2014/03/26/babys-first-garbage-collector.html">自己动手写GC</a>。<br />这种Naive的方式虽然简洁，但是却有很大的缺点：即mark和sweep阶段必须一口气执行完毕，不能分步骤进行，结果就是在进行GC时其他线程都必须挂起，也就是通常说的StopThe World。<br />原因在于：假如在mark完成后，新创建了若干对象，这些对象显然没有被标记，在本次的sweep阶段就会被清除，造成无法挽回的后果。</p><p>为了改进上述算法的时间和空间性能，Baker's algorithm应运而生：<br />每个分配的内存块只能属于四种状态之一：Marked(可达)/Enqueued(in theworklist)/Unknown(未处理)/Deallocated(已释放)，维护4个双向链表保存4个状态的对象。</p><ul><li>将root set中的所有对象移入enqueued链表；</li><li>当enqueued链表不空：<br />-- 将enqueued链表的对象移入marked链表；<br />-- 对于unknown链表中的被引用对象，移入enqueued链表。</li><li>合并unknown链表和Deallocated链表并释放，耗时<spanclass="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span>；</li><li>将marked链表中的所有对象移入unknown链表，耗时<spanclass="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span>。</li></ul><p>这样时间复杂度优化为runs in time proportional to the number ofreachable objects.</p><h2 id="generational-gc">Generational GC</h2><p>分代收集的核心思想是将内存划分为若干代，每次新的对象总是被分在新生代，新生代没有空间时，做一次迅速的GC，之后将新生代中剩余的对象移入nextgeneration，实在没有空间可用时，对整个内存进行一次GC。<br />Java的GC就是基于这种算法，新生代分为Eden和Survivor：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200705145530733.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />开始的分配都在eden中，满了之后做一次GC，将留下的对象移入survivor浅色区，具体过程可以参考文献中的200页。</p><h2 id="具体应用">具体应用</h2><ol type="1"><li>Python的GC主要结合了引用计数和分代回收2种策略，当对象的引用计数为0时立即回收该对象，如果出现循环引用，则等待分代回收算法清理该对象。</li></ol><h2 id="reference">Reference</h2><p><ahref="http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs143/cs143.1128/lectures/18/Slides18.pdf">GarbageCollection</a></p>]]></content>

      <title>The Annotated STL Sources</title>
      <link href="/posts/the-annotated-stl-sources/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2><p>《STL源码剖析》用来了解原理性的设计没什么问题，但是这本书实在太老，所有源码基于GNU2.9；现在语言的发展飞快，而且很多地方都是考虑兼容性等因素，设计非常复杂，也并不高效，我没有时间去搞明白所有实现，更没有时间实现标准库，所以只学了一小半就停了。</p><h2 id="六大组件">六大组件</h2><p>容器、算法、分配器、迭代器、适配器、仿函数。<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200423140448163.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /></p><h2 id="allocator">Allocator</h2><p>分配器用来为容器分配内存，分配器是class，有成员函数<code>allocate</code><code>deallocate</code>，调用<code>operator new()</code>会调用<code>malloc</code>，<code>operator delete()</code>调用<code>free</code>。<br />不同编译器的分配器实现稍有区别，不建议直接使用allocators，<code>int* p = allocator&lt;int&gt;().allocate(512)</code>会创建临时对象，归还还要指定大小：<code>allocator&lt;int&gt;().deallocate(p, 512)</code>。<br />但<code>malloc</code>归还时不需要指定大小，因为<code>malloc</code>时候会有<strong>cookie</strong>保存分配的内存块大小，如果每次申请内存都包含cookie的话，开销太大，并且频繁申请内存十分耗时。<br />GNU2.9觉得allocators太傻逼，自己用的是alloc的分配器，有16个单链表，每个链表负责某个特定大小的内存块分配，比如8B（该链表串了很多8B的小内存块），16B，...，容器需要内存会被调整到8的倍数，去相应的链表找，如果链表没有小块内存，就会调用<code>malloc</code>向OS申请一块大的，切成很多小的，串起来去分配，这样<code>malloc</code>次数会变小很多，而且cookie会少很多，时间和空间开销都会变小，碎片也少了。<br />GNU4.9没有使用alloc，使用<code>std::allocator</code>，allocator继承了new_allocator，有成员函数<code>allocate</code><code>deallocate</code>，调用<code>operator new()</code>会调用<code>malloc</code>，<code>operator delete()</code>调用<code>free</code>，一夜回到解放前。。。<br />4.9有很多扩展的分配器，2.9里的alloc变为了_pool_alloc，要改变默认的分配器，可以写<code>vector&lt;string, __gnu_cxx::_pool_alloc&lt;string&gt;&gt; vec</code>。</p><h2 id="list">list</h2><p>双向环状链表，end指向一个dummy node。<br />因为非连续，所以<code>++iterator</code>要重新设计，使得指向下一个元素，而不是错误的地址。<figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span

61B的HW2，具体实现<ahref="https://github.com/EIMadrigal/CS61B/tree/master/hw2">在这里</a>。这个项目是要模拟一个渗滤系统，最终目标是要通过蒙特卡洛方法计算出渗滤系统的阈值，主要会考察对并查集的使用而非实现。<br />渗滤有很多应用，比较重要的就是复合导电材料：刚开始是绝缘体，将金属作为导电材料逐渐掺入，填充到某临界值后，金属会形成一条导电网格组成的路径，完成从绝缘体到半导体、导体的转变，该临界值就是所谓的<strong>渗滤阈值</strong>。<br />模型是一个<spanclass="math inline">\(N*N\)</span>的网格图，每个格子有打开和关闭两种状态。如果一个格子是打开的，并且可以通过相邻的某些打开的格子连接到第一行的打开格子，那么该格子的状态就是full。如果最后一行有格子是full，那么系统就会发生渗滤。对于前面的例子，如果金属材料能形成一条从上到下的导电路径，那么就发生渗滤：<br /><img

inline">\(p^*\)</span>，当<spanclass="math inline">\(p&lt;p^*\)</span>时，系统几乎不可能发生渗滤；当<spanclass="math inline">\(p&gt;p^*\)</span>时，系统几乎一定发生渗滤：<br /><img

inline">\(O(N^2)\)</span>，其余方法都必须是<spanclass="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span>。<br />如果采用常规方法判断是否渗滤，那么至少也要遍历最后一行看看有没有full的格子，这样时间<spanclass="math inline">\(O(N)\)</span>无法满足要求。<br />问题就在于第一行和最后一行的格子数太多，减慢了我们的判断效率。那么如果我们在最上面和最下面设置两个虚拟节点，事情就会变得OK：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200613110636913.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />virtualTop负责连接第一行所有打开的结点，virtualBottom负责连接最后一行所有打开的结点，这样我们就把<spanclass="math inline">\(N\)</span>个点浓缩成了一个点：</p><ul><li>判断某点是否full时，只需要判断该点是否和virtualTop连接；</li><li>判断是否渗滤时，只要判断virtualTop和virtualBottom是否连接。</li></ul><p>这种解决方案看似很完美，但是有一个问题Backwash：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200613111558820.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />如果已经有一条从上到下的路，那么水流可以通过virtualBottom回流到最后一行已经打开的格子，而这些格子本不应该full。<br />这个问题的解决有点tricky，开始我是想通过周围格子的状态来判断是否full，即只有周围四个格子之一是full，当前格子才是full。但是如果要在<code>isFull()</code>里递归调用去判断周围格子，那么一定会爆栈；所以要判断周围格子只能通过是否和virtualTop连接，但是只要这个打开的格子在最后一行，就一定要和virtualBottom连接，如此一来只要有其他通路，那么该格子必然还是backwash，进而就会导致其它和该格子相连的也backwash。<br />举例来说：假如右边3个蓝色格子从上至下编号123，先打开3号，3号周围四个格子都没有和virtualTop连接，因此我们认为3号没有full，这没问题；但是接着打开2号，2号下面的格子（3号在最后一行且打开，必然和virtualBottom连接，即也和virtualTop连接）是和virtualTop连接的，因此我们判断2号是full，这显然错误。</p><p>没法用逻辑优化的时候，就应该转向用空间去优化。我们可以在开一个并查集，这个集合最多只包含virtualTop和地图中的所有格子，而将virtualBottom排除在外。判断full时，只要当前格子在新并查集中与virtualTop连接，那么必然full。</p><h2 id="monte-carlo-simulation">Monte Carlo Simulation</h2><p>为了估算阈值，需要做<spanclass="math inline">\(T\)</span>次独立重复实验：</p><ul><li>所有格子都设置为关闭；</li><li>随机选取一个关闭的格子，打开它，重复直至系统渗滤。</li></ul><p>那么这次试验的<spanclass="math inline">\(p^*\)</span>就是打开格子数/总数。</p><p>取<spanclass="math

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="前言">0 前言</h2><p>距离2015年高考已经过去了整整5年，这段日子埋藏着太多不堪。尽管现如今我已经开始了全新的生活，但仍想把自己曾经的问题和思考展示出来，一来当作对过去的告别，二来也希望这些教训能给境遇类似的人一些启发。</p><p>这篇文章字字血泪、句句属实，我不想熬制鸡汤或者贩卖焦虑。文中的一些想法都是通过亲身经历、思考、与前辈同学交流得到的，可能不太成熟，欢迎大家批评指正。</p><hr />认真去划决定命运的小船，却不知道未来会漂向哪里。<p align="right">——题记</p><h2 id="高中故事">1 高中故事</h2><p>文章题目虽然是高考五年记，但其实主题与高考并没有多大关系，而且上大学以后，我很少主动提起高考这档子事，只是为了故事完整，就从高中时代讲起。</p><p>高中三年是在一所县城高中，高考压力很小，学习也是波澜不惊。我并没有像传说中那么拼命学习，努力程度连初中都不如。相反，我的高中自在安逸，回想起来让人有些后怕。作为典型的“小县城学霸”，由于比较轻松就能考到前几名，所以我将大把大把的课余时间拿去运动，以至于已经主次不分。</p><p>做题总是很无聊，而我不知道是因为骄傲，还是因为懒散，遇到难题总是放弃思考、看看答案了事，看不懂就去睡觉，每天做些简单题（毫无必要）保持自信。事实上，我隐约知道外面有更大的世界，但却不知道那个世界是什么样子。那时我几乎没有可以追赶的目标（不像初中），这也许是高考失败的一个原因吧。自负、虚荣以及平日的偷懒终于在高三时酿成了苦果，那几次大型模考理综难度激增，跟平时训练完全不是一个套路。理综彻底被完爆的我后来再也没得过第一，化学甚至长期徘徊在及格边缘。看到这，你也许以为我会发奋努力上演逆袭神话，但现实永远是残酷的。实际上我并没有多少改变：该踢球踢球，该偷懒偷懒，甚至在四五月份时我都打算放弃物理，想着随便混几分算了。高考的目标也变得无所谓起来，反正那一直都是挂在墙上终将被戳破的泡沫罢了。到最后我干脆抱着爱考哪考哪的弃疗心态，只希望尽快毕业。</p><p>我之前对于“小县城学霸”这个词一直嗤之以鼻，即使高中物理老师曾经不止一次强调过我们只是一个县城中学。不过当时我觉得学霸就是学霸（现在显然我自己并不是），厉害的人到哪都那么厉害，哪有什么小县城不小县城。不过后来当这类人的思维方式深深影响我的时候，才发现原来老一辈人的说法未必都是错的，“不听老人言，吃亏在眼前”这句古语也并非空穴来风。</p><p>2015年的高考和往年一样平淡无奇，出分后我异常平静（要是没上600该多好，那我就坚持复读了）。我想学物流管理或者工商管理，前者是因为我喜欢看到井井有条的交通运输网，最终将东西错落有致地归位，后者则纯粹是因为高大上。不过很不幸，这些想法并没有得到亲戚父母的支持，他们说那些专业虚无缥缈，毕业后不好找工作。</p><p>信息的闭塞使得我（包括那些已经工作的亲朋）并不了解各个专业的细节以及未来可能的职业轨迹，我甚至搞不清电子信息与计算机之间的关系。<strong>18岁前的我们只知道读书，习以为常的主流价值观就是“努力学习，考高分，上好大学”，在这样主流价值观的裹挟下，很多人相信“一分耕耘，一分收获”，彷佛只要足够拼命学习，一切都会迎刃而解。然而这种简单的线性的思维方式完全是对真实生活的一种片面归纳，强行被灌输的这些价值观念是否契合当代社会真实的发展轨迹，甚至是否正确，都有待商榷。也许当某一天我们突然发现自己的世界观无法解释见识到的种种现象时，才会在深夜里辗转反侧痛哭流涕的同时，试图去打破曾经的桎梏，而人生信条的崩塌和重塑无疑会是极具撕裂感的、漫长的过程。</strong></p><p>此时的我们对社会的认知极度匮乏，高中也完全没有相关的职业指导教育，盲目地填报志愿，这是当时很多人的通病，我也不例外。在西工大三航学院、厦大经济学和西安交大的来回纠结中，最后一天将交大的专业大致按照历年录取分的高低依次填进志愿表，这在现在看来是多么不可思议的一件事，而我，最后就是这么干的。就这样，稀里糊涂地来到了交大电子信息类。</p><h2 id="懵懂时光">2 懵懂时光</h2><p>到大学后，集体住宿搞得我很不适应，晚上总是很晚才睡着，早上起个大早去跑操，结果就是几乎所有早上的课我都一睡而过。那些课程我也着实提不起兴趣，考试总是随缘突击，结果就是期末挂了一门工程制图，那种空间想象能力我差到不可救药。我个人对新环境的适应一直都很慢，所以进入一个崭新的阶段，开始时总是做得十分差劲。</p><p>不过好在我并非一个一成不变的人，于是开始尝试去改变。由于迟迟找不到方向所在，试错的过程持续了将近两年半的时间。选修了一门职业规划的课程，想借此明确未来的打算，弥补这本该是很早前就完成的人生必修课，不过这门课与大学物理一样无趣；参加了数模比赛，虽然得了奖，但除了提升软件安装和论文写作技能以外，并没有什么新奇之处；参加了社团的支教，这是我当时唯一觉得价值非凡的事情，这段经历也对我后来的想法产生了重大影响，可是这并没有从本质上解决我的问题：<strong>我未来到底想干嘛</strong>？辅修了金融学，也不过帮助我提早排除了一个未来可能从事的行业而已；去奶茶店进行所谓的“创业”，半年后店铺出租，我“失业”了；甚至于无聊到搞了一个公众号，想看看自己有没有自媒体运营方面的喜好，最后也是无功而返。</p><p>说来倒也有些矛盾，除了少数大神一直都有明确的方向或者可以兼顾方方面面以外，我们大多普通人，大学里如果一直不停尝试各种方向去试图寻找兴趣，那必然会分散精力，成绩不够好带来的代价就是后期通过更多时间和精力去弥补。可是如果很少尝试，一条道走到黑，那后果也是可想而知。两种决定都会付出代价，只是时间早晚而已。</p><p>我想既然这些都无济于事，就先提高绩点吧。于是从大二下学期直到毕业，我都在认真学习。即使信号与系统、模电数电那些专业课依然没有学懂，但我发现考试与学没学懂关系并没有那么密切，我居然拿到了在大学的第一个100分。欣喜之余，我隐约觉得这里面有什么问题，但是也懒得思考。</p><p><strong>生活就是这么奇妙，收获的成果有时并不与你的付出成正比</strong>。很快我就发现即使我再努力学习，平均分最高也不过89，全系排名好的时候30多，差的时候50多，那时我才初步意识到<strong>人与人的差距有时候不是通过努力就可以弥补的</strong>。</p><p>成绩上不去，我就想试着去开发一下自己的科研禀赋。于是大三寒假我报了ML方向的一个组，不过我压根没有见过报名的那个教授本人，而是被直接分在了一个副教授手下，并进而被分给了他的一个博士。见不到leader本人我完全不觉得惊讶，毕竟IEEEFellow怎么可能去带一个本科生？但令我不能理解的是我明明报的是ML，但平时的工作却完全是网络通信方向，又是讨厌的信号和从未搞懂的相位。看了一个寒假的论文，帮助他们测试实验数据，在组会上讲论文，尽管我还不知道自己想做什么，但却知道自己厌恶什么。随着时间推移，我愈发觉得自己正在南辕北辙，加之实验室不在一个校区，后来也就主动退出了，科研初探随即宣告失败。</p><p>到此为止，能想到的方式我都一一尝试，可是收效甚微。那段时间我时常在球场散步，一圈又一圈，脑子里就想着两个问题：<strong>我到底喜欢做什么？我未来到底要干嘛？</strong></p><p>人生总有想不明白的问题，苦苦思索不得其解，只能先搁置起来。事情在大三下学期出现了转机，我们系开放了两门CS的课：OS和微机原理，加上ACM大佬们的影响，我开始发现计算机课程的乐趣，那是我第一次认认真真、彻彻底底搞懂了一门课，甚至于我竟然乐意废寝忘食去完成课程的Project。正反馈也来得恰到好处，两门课我都拿到了90+的成绩，那时我隐约有了转CS的想法。顺便要纠正一下，很多人误以为通信转CS很容易，事实上除了三四门相同的专业课以外，通信与CS本科期间学习的东西就像是两条平行线，通信转CS和转金融没什么差别。可能是听到太多科班CS大佬的故事，我始终觉得自己与科班出身的差距无异于一条鸿沟，以至于敬畏到忘记自己该学些什么，尽管后来发现事实并非如此，<strong>人有时候总是自己吓唬自己</strong>。</p><p>说到这就难免谈到劝退的话题，生/化/环/材被黑的体无完肤，大家都要去金融/CS，有时候我也会想：作为所谓的名校学生，我们享受了比较优质的教育资源，然而却少有人愿意投身基础科学研究，这才是科技兴盛的基石，过去不久的华为中兴就是典型的正反例。也难怪有人戏谑“中国只有互联网，没有计算机科学”，我们的互联网公司都在模仿美帝，腾讯学习ICQ，百度学习Google，阿里学习eBay，可是我们却没有看到美帝不仅有这些应用层的公司，还有Intel，Apple，Qualcomm等一大批芯片硬件厂商作为基石，而我们的BAT又有谁做基石呢？一股脑转去高薪行业，这会不会有些太过自私了呢？曾经的理想主义色彩淡薄了许多，我是否也变成了所谓的“精致的利己主义者”，而忽略了对社会的那份责任？但转念又一想，如果一个社会逼得许多人转去金融/CS，那是不是这个社会本身出现了问题呢？遇到一些不顺心的事，千万不要想不开，很多时候不是你的问题，而是整个社会的运行机制出现了偏差。</p><p>由此也可以看出：<strong>世俗意义上的成功更重要的决定因素是历史的进程，选择远远比努力重要得多，而信息和自我定位则会很大程度上左右你的选择。某些情况下努力可能只占1分，而成长环境、家境状况、历史进程、个人选择、贵人相助甚至运气则可能占9分，甚至99分。</strong></p><h2 id="曲折岁月">3 曲折岁月</h2><p>时间飞逝，一转眼三年已如白驹过隙。大一的成绩太差，总成绩大概只落在了全系40多名，掐指一算就知道在保研边缘，如果出国的大佬比较多，我也许会有机会。所以我不敢怠慢，两手准备，保研自然最好，若是失败也不能耽误考研。</p><p>大概是8月份回校的，那阵就看数学，没什么状态，大概心里还是侥幸着能够保送，也不知道专业课该看计算机还是通信的。9月大家人心惶惶，有出国考T考G的，有各种保外保内的，还有穿着西装到处参加面试的，大家也都比较焦虑，放弃考研的也大有人在。浑浑噩噩就到了9月中旬，保研名额给到了第42名，而我是第45名。颇具戏剧性的是，之前坊间传言会有20多个专硕名额，搞得人心惶惶，我还幻想着保专硕算了，后来也不了了之。</p><p>这下本以为彻底死心，考虑到自己当时备考效率极低，根本看不进去书，加上周围的同学纷纷拿到了offer，我下定决心找工作。于是就完善简历，练练编程的题目，投了华为、中兴、网易等几个公司的研发岗，差不多耗了一个礼拜，也收到了陆陆续续的笔面试通知。没想到生活总是会有<del>意外的惊喜</del>，系里通知有一个国防科大的普通生定向保送名额，在我前面的2个人都放弃了，再加上军校的缘故，我竟然没怎么思考就选择了放弃，这该是第一波坑操作。</p><p>后来不知怎么滴，也许是和老师朋友聊了很多，也许觉得自己还是太菜，莫名其妙又想读研了，稀里糊涂就推掉了所有的面试，一是不够自信，二来不想分心。又把书重新拿了起来，滚去复习。奇怪的是：这次竟然可以静下心来，仔仔细细做题了。这该死的第二波坑操作，事实证明：<strong>秋招远比春招重要并且容易得多</strong>，这一点我会在后面解释。</p><p>时间来到了9月底，这下终于可以安心复习了。出于对通信专业课的阴影，我还是选了CS，还有是因为大三时几门计算机的课学的还不错，倒也饶有兴趣。</p><p>那，选哪个学校好呢？我心想，既然要考研了，本科比不过他们，研究生的学校可不能输给他们。殊不知这就是典型的“高中生心态”，<strong>没有根据自己的定位和当前的规划去做出恰当的选择，而是冲着高大上的标签去做决定，这样的决定显然是冲动并且幼稚的</strong>。清北太难了，比XJTU好的就ZJU、SJTU、FDU、NJU，最想去的是SJTU，查了之后才知道2018年SJTUCS就招了两个学硕、10几个专硕，我想难度太大了，遂杀掉（题外，2019SJTUCS难度蛮低的）。之后查了这几所之后，发现NJU分数又低、招人又多，就开始复习NJU的专业课。</p><p>专业课一共有5门，很难，每天看的头昏眼花。屋漏偏逢连夜雨，10月招生简章出来后，NJU的名额还是和往年一样多，结果过了差不多一个礼拜，官网突然把名额杀了一半，剩20几个了。我想，这也变难了，再加上群里大家信誓旦旦的样子，和朋友商量后，我在来回纠结和迷之自信中又换了学校（题外，我的分去年上NJU没啥问题）。就剩ZJU和FDU了，FDU虽然好考，但专硕却不提供住宿，还恰是从这一年开始，ZJU就这样成了唯一的选择。结果表明，复习时间真的太过紧张，尤其是专业课。408的难度相信都有所耳闻，时而做对，时而连着错很多，心情也像过山车似的起起伏伏，无数次都有撕掉卷子的冲动。我只能死马当作活马医，其实直到最后，我甚至连习题集都没有做完，很多知识点也是一知半解。这该死的第三波骚操作。</p><p>当时和几个出国狗一起自习，看过他们托福考出来的欣喜，也见过GRE310的落寞，当然还有那一起吃饭时互吐的苦水。我说考完的日子就舒服了，说我已经列好了长长的TODOList。他们说，其实你有没有想过，这本身就是人生啊！</p><p>12月的日子很难熬，临近考试，觉得自己不是在查漏补缺，而是在女娲补天。心情总是飘忽不定，仿若过山车一般，题目全对了会喜上眉梢，英语阅读5错4时又觉人生无望，揉过的专业课卷子冷静下来还是只能乖乖去看。</p><p>说来我算是一个乐观主义者，或许是<strong>人总是愿意相信对自己有利的事情</strong>。寒假可能有一丝落榜的焦虑，但大部分时间我还是在准备机试，每天都在做算法题（题外，这大概是唯一正确的事了，春招用上了）。</p><h2

折戟沉沙</h2><p>出成绩后就得知没有过线，我顿觉失望与惶恐。稍一比较，才发现别人的生活多姿多彩，自己反而是一直学习却连考试都考不好的傻逼。当天的我十分慌张，立刻去查找调剂信息。得知中科大软院收校外调剂，心情才稍稍舒缓了些。虽然学费贵点，但去中科大读个硕士还是不错的。</p><p>看着94分的专业课，我一时语塞。有些不甘心的我一遍又一遍回忆着这大半年发生的事情:本科通信、三跨浙大、备考也算不上充分，落榜也实属正常。我一直尝试重新认识自己，可现在愈发地不认识，像是一个完完全全的陌生人。刚开学后的那两天我处于弃疗状态，觉得什么都无所谓了，爱咋咋滴吧，调去差点的也行，随便找份工作也行。</p><p>冷静了几天，又觉得这些挫折并非坏事，现在受挫总比将来走向社会好。况且成年人应当为自己的错误付出代价，不论是选择出了问题，还是不够努力。挫折对于我而言绝对谈不上财富，只是希望让我这个转变缓慢的人长点教训。我不是一个一蹶不振的人，也不是度量狭小，只是受了打击，犯了错，总得学点什么，不是吗？积极的心态很重要，凡事总要向前看，过去的就过去吧。工作要好好找，调剂也要努力争取，解决好当下，求一份心安。</p><p>鸡蛋不能放在同一个篮子里，我又迅速确定了其它几个调剂的学校，排除了调剂本校和浙大相关专业的可能。后来也在老师和同学的推荐下了解了一些研究所，但大多是军工性质，我并不想去。很无聊的名校情节以及差强人意的总分使我把比本科差的学校都直接排除，最后就确定了3个：科软、山东大学、中科院成都所。</p><p>我想着这3个再差也能去一个吧，但是<strong>现实远比想象的更加要命</strong>。直到3月10几号才知道科软从今年开始不收校外生；接着是山大，学硕调剂有3个名额，专硕有11个，我想着报个人多的，却不知再次选择出错：专硕的分数高的吓人，没有拿到复试资格，而学硕反而分数低的多。拖了最长时间的就是中科院，预调剂很早就填了，我甚至都填完了政审表，傻傻地把这个当成最后的救命稻草，直到3月底没看到名单，我还是相信会来的，这大概因为我实在想要这个硕士吧。到了4月10日，我对比了去年的招生人数和今年一志愿人数，发现可能不会再有调剂了（之前发邮件问了但没有回信）。</p><p>期间也不敢落下春招，当时想得太简单：不能既没学上，又没工作。一口气投了十几份简历，所幸除了冲突和放弃的之外，都拿到了笔面试通知。因为我是半路CS，再加上春招已经没有大公司的职位，所以也投了一些非技术岗。</p><p>说个题外话，找工作一定要在秋招，因为春招只是秋招的补录，名额少、难度大。拿我作为反例，春招想要投递大公司（BAT），都已经没了HC，错过这一次你就再也不是应届生了，自然也就没了校招的待遇。我后来才了解到：阿里巴巴光是实习生转正和提前批就已经占掉了绝大部分HC，甚至于秋招都已经没什么机会了。</p><p>那段时间我几乎没怎么休息，也没心思去休息，只希望3月底可以确定去处，未来的不确定对人真是煎熬。认真去准备的有五家：TP、OPPO、浦发总行、华为和字节跳动。前三家都给了offer，华为没有了消息，字节跳动则是笔试挂掉了。后来突然发现自己跪在了哪里，华为这种公司，或者说几乎所有公司，都需要你来好好干活。但我的致命错误就在于太老实，而没有学会伪装。我甚至在主管面说自己还是想继续深造，如此愚蠢的错误我接连犯了很多次，这是学会的第一课。</p><p>我其实很讨厌面试时看重忠心的公司，现代企业本来就该是我付出劳动力、你付给我报酬，我当然会把份内的事做好，你也不要占用我其他时间。情怀不能当饭吃，这种忽悠我觉得非常小儿科，甚至不是现代企业所需要的管理方式。</p><p>找工作的心态一直在“卧槽，我还挺牛B的”/“唉，我真傻B”之间来回切换：某司HR主动打电话问我要不要去；那么简单的题目竟然不会做；某司竟然直接免掉了高管面；我怎么问了那么傻X的问题……唯一的共同点在于N轮面试真的会把人榨干。</p><p>后来拒了TP，其实OPPO也没签，一直在等菊厂的结果，直到打听到别人已经拿到了offer，才确认自己凉了。这时OPPO已经快要截止，唯一庆幸的就是自己联系了一起去面试的同学，这才没有傻等下去。虽然我知道不能以偏概全，但OPPO的HR在招聘过程中展现出来的专业素养比某为不知道高到哪里去了，“店大欺客”的道理是明摆着的。</p><p>一步一步把一手好牌打成了今天这个样子，我终于体会到其实<strong>人生的道路是由很多因素共同决定的，并且很多机会都是转瞬即逝</strong>。另外，自己也就是中人之资、半吊子水平而已。</p><p>尽管如此，起初拿到offer后，看着协议上的薪资，我有些兴奋：虽然package不大，但就我了解的情况，也算是比较好的待遇了。我庆幸自己搭上了CS的末班车，还被邀请给下一届分享找工作的经验，甚至开始早早谋划起在另一个城市的生活......</p><h2 id="痛定思痛">5 痛定思痛</h2><p>草草签约以后，我总觉得哪里不对劲，却说不上来。<strong>我发现自己比之前进步一点的是遇到不明白的问题，会去思考、去交流、去尝试得到一个答案，尽管这个答案不甚完美，甚至在上帝视角下都不一定正确，但这也比敷衍了事强上一万倍。</strong></p><p>考研失败就像压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草，让我开始跳出虚荣的怪圈，真正重新认识、评估自己。是不是一切从开始就错了呢？为什么在给予别人建议时头头是道，到了自己就非得撞得头破血流呢？万千世界，大家虽然所处位置不同，但每个人都在寻找自己的局部最优，而且结果好像都不错。唯独我，好像学习率太大，损失函数竟有些发散，距离最优点也越来越远。<strong>那种疼痛感，就像从崖边跌落，远比在平地上摔倒更令人刻骨铭心。</strong></p><p>我像过电影般一遍遍回忆这几年的事情，也时常和各种背景的人聊天（徐老师的<ahref="https://eimadrigal.github.io/2019/12/02/%E8%80%81%E5%AE%9E%E4%BA%BA%E7%9A%84%E6%91%B8%E7%B4%A2%E4%B8%8E%E5%8F%8D%E6%80%9D---%E5%86%99%E5%9C%A8%E9%AB%98%E8%80%83%E4%B8%83%E5%B9%B4%E5%90%8E/">文章</a>给了我很大启发，我也和徐老师交流过，人很nice）。我逐渐开始发现自己的问题：周围都是IT的同学，大多都想着高薪买房，目前看来的确不错，但或许正是在这种<strong>单线程思维</strong>的浸染以及<strong>同质化的比较</strong>下，我也在不知不觉中迷失了自我，这种象牙塔带来的禁锢总有一天要被打破。更加本质的原因在于我自己<strong>本身没有一个清晰的定位并且没有明确的职业规划，哪怕只是五年、十年的规划</strong>。兜兜转转又回到了那个熟悉而又陌生的问题：我未来到底想做什么？媒体软文总是告诉我们要不忘初心、坚持梦想，却从来不告诉我们怎样寻找初心？怎样选择梦想？</p><p>与在国内互联网公司实习的同学交流后，我看到了高薪背后的挣扎：长时间的加班使得很多人到一定年龄后只能主动退出。以前我从来没有想明白：为什么某为每年从各大高校招聘那么多人，企业利润总是有限的，招那么多人怎么能消化呢？某为又不像国企，政府有命令必须帮助国家解决就业，国家养活完全可以理解。后来当我某一天突然看到了某为的离职率，才明白其实不过是数量巨大的新人换旧人而已。很多年轻人几乎没有自己的生活，疲惫而又无奈。这才是普通大众的真实情况，我们不该只看到某某大佬创业成功去纳斯达克敲钟，某某大佬又融到了C轮，这种“<strong>幸存者偏差</strong>”掩盖了“<strong>一将功成万骨枯</strong>”的现实，也让我重新审视自己：你愿意一直从事这样的职业吗？显然，答案是否定的，因为我始终觉得工作不该成为生活的主旋律，还有很多更有意义的事情等着我去完成。</p><p>顺便插一句：如果你不确定自己要干嘛，<strong>趁早去实习</strong>，接触真实的工作环境远比在象牙塔里意淫要实在得多，提早打破学校里单一价值评价体系带来的桎梏。此外，实习的好处也自不必多说，牛逼公司的实习永远都是简历上最耀眼的闪光点，甚至于在互联网，实习经历大于其它GPA、获奖、社团所带来的价值之和。</p><p>被碾压的感觉与证明自己的情绪混在一起，使得我对自己没有明确的定位。而选择上的失误更多的不是来自于信息的匮乏，而是选择的依据出现了问题：<strong>没有基于未来的职业规划来做出决定，反倒是冲着高大上的标签或者亲朋好友的期待，这样的选择能有多少理智的成分呢</strong>？扪心自问，之前那一连串的操作都是基于一个错误而又功利的方向进行，真正想要的和你实际做的完全是两码事，两者间的夹角至少也有80度，甚至可能是钝角，量出这个角度我花了整整一年，而有的人则花了五年、十年甚至一辈子，这样无头苍蝇乱撞般的努力毫无意义，甚至可能起到反作用。</p><p>是的，之前的选择出了很大的问题，现在的锅确实也得背着。可是这并不是彻底击倒我的理由，换句话说，我应该去纠正之前的错误，而不是一蹶不振。之前说过：选择比努力重要，但<strong>通过交流、经历、思考不断纠正方向的能力则比选择还要重要</strong>，这样才会带来螺旋式的上升而不是断崖式下降。</p><p>明白了错误的主要原因和以后的职业规划后，再一次重新做出的选择看起来那么自然和水到渠成。再强调一遍：<strong>你对自己的定位评估会影响你的选择，而选择却远比努力更重要。你的定位应该取决于你对自己未来的规划，而不是那些高大上的标签或者亲戚朋友的看法，这会让你失去对自己的准确判断，德不配位，必然撞墙。</strong></p><p>不撞南墙不回头，这一年撞得头破血流，跟自己的无知、幼稚、局限斗争了一年。同样，也成长了一年，甚至比以往任何时候都成长地更快。有时候回过头去想，如果这一路很顺利的话，现在又会是怎样一番景象？如果当初选择了保送，如果选择了秋招工作，如果没有选择ZJU计算机，如果调剂到地球科学系，如果去工作了，如果……可惜没如果，所以从过去汲取教训后，最好向前看。盗用一句台词：</p><blockquote><p>You have got to put the past behind you before you can move on.</p></blockquote><h2 id="自食其果">6 自食其果</h2><p>放弃这个比较有诱惑力的工作而去赌一个未知的将来，要说没有压力肯定没人相信，但我当时的决定却相当清晰，即使违约的事情还没有谈妥，即使二战期间的食宿还没有着落。因为我在用未来的职业规划当作决策目标，不再过多考虑暂时的收益，因此决定不再是冲动的。我一直以为自己是悲惨的，大四的最后才确定初步的生涯规划，但实际上我又是幸运的，因为还有一大批人甚至中年以前都没有明白。</p><p>真的要感谢我有一对开明的父母，当我不停地自我怀疑和否定之前的观点与行为，他们总会给予无限的鼓励与支持。</p><p>度过了煽情的毕业季，处理完违约的事情，考完驾照后，我便开始逐渐矫正自己的生活，为过去的错误买单。又是8月回校，心境却大有不同，坚定目标后，事情也不是一帆风顺。记得李健有一句歌词：等待和耕耘，谁更辛苦？我的答案是等待，那段时间我偶有焦虑，填补焦虑最好的方式就是找些事情做，可是闲下来之后，<strong>等待的日子却最是难熬</strong>。</p><p>每段崭新的日子一开始总是来不及悲伤。尽管我十分讨厌把相同的事情做两次以上，但或许是因为新鲜感，刚去的几周学习状态感觉还不错。逐渐理顺了生活之后，最难熬的一段日子在9月底10月初到来。接下来的几周我严重失眠：经常是晚上8/9点睡觉，躺床上思考很多事情，凌晨2/3点才入睡，然后就一直睡到大中午才起床，接着去吃饭学习，生物钟彻底陷入混乱。虽然我不止一次告诉自己：几个月很快就会过去，也明白路该怎么走，但是<strong>心病难医</strong>，还是会经常抱怨Whyalways me/Why always the wronganswer。我希望时光过得快一些，每天复习都数着日子。虽然看起来还算正常，但我有些担心会不会在哪一瞬间突然崩溃。我尝试了很多种方法试图让自己平静，回归正常的作息。</p><p>由于学校很傻逼的支付系统，扫码吃饭可供选择的窗口少得可怜，不过比物质上的单一更加要命的是心理上的波动。那段日子我真真切切感受到了人生的艰难：每天和活人说话不超过10句，我擅长独处，但还是一度怀疑自己能否忍受这样的孤独？能否坚持下去？接下来的日子又该如何度过？</p><p>幸好我有自己的日常爱好和排遣方式。除了正常的复习时间，我尝试用音乐、文学和足球去填补漫长的空闲：去看各种人物的访谈，从李健到村上春树；去听各种风格的音乐，从钢琴曲到摇滚乐，后来我惊讶地发现自己一年里竟然听了8000多首歌；去了解各种军事话题，从二战到伊拉克战争；去看各式各样的人生轨迹，从职业选择到人生理想。那段时间最开心的事情就是写博客、听音乐和刷评论，那就像是我自己的避风港。每隔一段时间我就会迷上一个大师：从RichardClayderman到Beethoven, 从石进到周杰伦，从JoeHisaishi到Maksim，从李健到Akina，甚至无聊到去扒一些<ahref="https://www.cnblogs.com/EIMadrigal/p/11421473.html">抄袭的作品</a>、在足球APP上和人撕逼。</p><p align="center"></p><center class="half"><img src="2021050914403540.jpg" height="25%" width="25%"/>图片更新于2021.5.9</center><p>为了调整生物钟，我决定用早起对抗失眠，学了很多<ahref="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/34952593">快速入睡</a>的技巧。深夜自我怀疑的时候，就去回想毕设导师对我能力的认可，她告诉我不能因为一次失误就这样自暴自弃，甚至在毕设答辩时，其他老师问我将来什么打算，我回答工作，老师仍然在表达惋惜。为了避免枯燥，我试图在每天晚上为第二天制定计划，并在完成小小的目标后奖励自己一顿美食（每隔一段时间都会去某个固定的小店吃饭）。后来不知是因为生活的惯性还是出于对第二人生的追求，我的效率渐渐提高，并养成了程序化的一天：早餐、学习、午饭、午休、学习、晚饭、学习、跑步、洗澡、沙雕视频（美食/老剧）、维护博客、睡觉。不可否认的是，尽管有时候仍然觉得自己像个可笑的小丑，但情况一直在好转。这种井井有条的生活给予了我长期的专注，使我得以脱离苦海。<img src="20200528111916687.png" alt="在这里插入图片" />于是从10月下旬直到考前，我都变得异常平静。<strong>在那段低谷的日子里，收到了许多老师、前辈、同学以及食堂大叔的照顾和鼓励，也包括那些远在网络彼岸的未曾谋面的陌生人，在此一并感谢~</strong></p><p>我原本坚定地以为，高考考成那个鬼样子是因为没有认真去学，去复读一年肯定会有巨大的提高。不过经历了那几个月，现在我觉得结果真的未可知：心态、压力等等因素共同作用下导致的结果可能会谬之千里。</p><p>在这一年里，我听到过太多的诉苦：工作后的同学又想回来读研，而且固执地认为研究生的待遇好、升职快；还遇到了许多正在读研的学长学姐后悔自己没有早早去工作挣钱，积累社会经验。两种想法没有对错，还是那句老掉牙的话：因人而异。不置可否的是，<strong>人都是有损失厌恶的，比较必然带来不快，乃至伤害</strong>。以前我总是转不过这个弯来，或者更确切地说，潜意识里不想让自己转过这个弯。如果放眼整个社会，你会发现，<strong>人生从来就不是什么公平的游戏</strong>，别人比你少读几年书、多挣一些钱根本就是没什么大不了的事。有一大堆人压根不需要读书、打工挣钱，就可以家财万贯，你奋斗一辈子可能都无法到达别人的起点，难道我们就放弃生活了吗？大家都是普通人，甚至夸张一些，都是社会最底层的人，没有谁比谁高贵或卑微，为什么要比来比去互相伤害呢？</p><p>将读研作为缓冲的人无非两种情况：不知道自己要做啥；知道了要做什么但时间已经不足以得到理想的结果，别无选择。对我个人而言，如果去工作，可能以后选择的权利会少一些。三年的缓冲一是为了弥补之前犯下的错误，二是为了让自己将来有一些小小的选择权，不用一直996。基于职业规划的前提下，我想该怎么做也已经非常明确了。当然这只是我自己的情况，其他人，比如本科时已经积攒够了资本，那大可以直接工作；对于立志进入学术界的同学，那继续出国深造才是最好的选择，所以才说因人而异。</p><p>初试后我压根没有对答案，只是小小放松了一下，庆祝这段岁月的结束，也是迎接下一段更加艰难的旅程。终于松了口气，不为别的，只为有时间做自己的事情了，<strong>自由的感觉真好</strong>。</p><p>回家后，一边等待成绩，一边准备实习。找实习的过程并没有比这半年的生活轻松多少，本来打算3月份复试后立即找实习，拿到录取资格就可以算是在校生。结果人算不如天算，没想到疫情居然持续了这么久，2/3月的时候遥遥无期，也不知道什么时候复试，如果复试拖到4/5月，结束后就只剩6/7/8这3个月，很多公司都是至少实习3个月，这样找实习的时间几乎没有。所以从2月份开始，通过各位前辈和同学的内推，大大小小投了国内外几十家互联网企业：网易、字节、华为、深信服、微软、依图、百度、腾讯、小米、Amazon、IBM、Intel、广联达......起初我觉得非常奇怪，除了2家公司打电话了解情况后，其他的都杳无音讯，唯一的机会来自于网易，不过我的面试实在糟糕。后来特意查了一下，发现非在读生签实习协议违反劳动合同法。知道这事以后，我也就基本放弃，不再强求，如意算盘再一次落空。</p><h2 id="重新起跑">7 重新起跑</h2><p>2月中旬看到初试成绩后，我觉得应该没什么问题，复试准备得很放松，把更多时间用来思考问题、夯实基础以及整理散落的片段。</p><p>复试虽然延期了2个月，但一切顺利。感谢我交的老师，面试时仍然在鼓励我，问的最多的就是去年的经历，告诉我不要以为没去ZJU就亏了，告诉我XJTU也不差，结束时说欢迎我来交大的确有些感动。在打趣的过程中，我能感觉到老师们那种不服气的精神，但同时我也明白品质和实力几无关系，就像托尔斯泰说的：<strong>只有伟大的作品，没有伟大的作家</strong>。我十分清醒，自己的水平目前确实很low，只有按照计划踏踏实实去做。</p><p>初试成绩公布后，我就联系了一堆老师，除了直接拒绝的，剩下某老师告诉我复试后才能确定名额，拟录取名单公布后，该老师问我是否读博，在得到否定的回答后，告诉我2天后跟他确认。但实际上，学硕名额非常紧张，有几个老师主动联系，我也意识到再等下去无济于事，赶快联系想跟的其他老师，很不幸的是：学硕名额几乎全都告罄。剩下一些不太想做的方向，出于无奈，只能群发了5个老师碰一碰运气。只要能实习、人品不至于太难以言表，是否push我都没什么问题，因为我只是要个学位证而已，即使这样也还是从下午3点找到晚上10点。</p><p>一年多的时间，我个人也变得更加平静，所以早早联系的老师一直吊着我，最后放我鸽子，我也无所谓。甚至看到自己出现在拟录取名单的第一行时，我也少有欣喜，脑子里想的只是烟酒生期间去哪实习，经济独立要怎么做，能不能早点拿到毕业证。</p><p>实习无望，只有做些其它事来消耗日子：拿到王道的助教资格，可能是这几个月为数不多的好消息。</p><p>人在回顾前一阶段的自己时，大多会觉得幼稚，正如现在翻看几年前的朋友圈，尴尬癌就会复发，所谓的成长究竟是好事还是坏事呢？<strong>随机漫步的人生又有谁说的清楚</strong>？甚至一年前我都从来没想过会是今天这个局面，顺便推荐一本有点虚无主义色彩的书《随机漫步的傻瓜》，看完后你可能会发现运气和概率竟然在人生中扮演了如此重要的角色。</p><p><strong>喜欢什么，就放手去做吧。人生的许多问题，只有自己亲身经历过，才能够给出回答</strong>。如雷军在<ahref="https://v.qq.com/x/page/m0857uh1apx.html">采访</a>中所说：</p><blockquote><p>雷布斯：人生不要太多的勉强，不要强迫自己做什么。我觉得做自己喜欢的事情，可能是最佳的选择。因为你喜欢这个方向，喜欢做这件事情，我觉得爱好比什么强迫都管用。</p><p>主持人：如果不知道自己喜欢什么呢？</p><p>雷布斯：那就看直觉。</p><p>主持人：也没有直觉？</p><p>雷布斯：那就撞上什么干什么，这些冥冥之中姻缘注定的，反正撞到什么是什么。人生就是这样的一场经历嘛。你撞到这个事情，你不知道自己喜不喜欢，你先干了再说，你不喜欢还可以改。不要怕选择，你不喜欢可以改。</p><p>主持人：可能大家总是怕选错吧，走弯路吧？</p><p>雷布斯：这个选错是必然的事，每个人都会做很多很多的选择，我觉得选择一定会出错。关键是提高选对的成功率，而不是说怕选错。每个人一辈子，可能做了一千个选择、一万个选择，怎么让你重要的选择不出错，或者少出错，这是关键，那些小的选择，无所谓对与错。</p></blockquote><p>人啊，总是逃不过真香定律：本科时黑的最起劲的一个地方，迟到了一年，几个月后又将重新去往。不过这次与五年前不同的是：我知道了<strong>Whoam I</strong>，也弄清了<strong>Where am Igoing</strong>，以及大致明白了<strong>How to get there</strong>。</p><h2 id="小结">8 小结</h2><p>折腾了这么多，成长的阵痛依然历历在目。有些时候道理就在那里，可是不痛撞南墙就是明白不了。撞得头破血流才体会到了下面这些道理（不保证正确，只是我现在的看法，每个人都会有局限，仅供参考）：</p><ol type="1"><li><strong>选择比努力更重要，你的当前状态就是由之前的每一步决定和行为导致的。获取足够的信息是做出正确决定的前提，多和不同背景的人交流（多约饭）是获取信息的一种方式；</strong></li><li><strong>做决定时多考虑未来的职业规划，少考虑沉没成本，更不要冲着高大上的标签或者亲朋好友的期待；</strong></li><li><strong>独立思考和自我纠错会是极其重要并且稀缺的品性，这种能力的提高都需要亲身实践（跳几次坑就明白了）；</strong></li><li><strong>世俗意义下的成功评价标准与你在哪所学校读书、成绩有多好、科研多牛逼并不是强相关，所以非名校的同学完全没有必要自暴自弃，主动获取信息并做出明智的决定，最后比名校学生优秀的大有人在，我已经亲身见识过很多这类人了；</strong></li><li><strong>对于名校同学，千万不要沉迷于学校牌子、竞赛获奖这些光环带来的麻醉中，个人差异远比学校和专业的差异大得多，趁早找到自己的生涯规划：多去申请实习或者通过其他方式进而提前排除错误选项，越早付出的代价越小；</strong></li><li><strong>不要用战术上的勤奋掩盖战略上的失败，做事前先想明白Why，再去考虑How；</strong></li><li><strong>一尘不染的事情是没有的，完美只存在于梦境中，认清过去的错误，面对当下的现实，未来重新做人；</strong></li><li><strong>综上，想要避免痛苦，就要尽早认清自己曾经、现在、将来一直都是loser的事实，每天做个乐呵呵的傻逼，也挺好。</strong></li></ol><p>伏案涕零，不知所言！</p>]]></content>

-1 \\  1 &amp;0\\  \end{bmatrix}\)</span>，<spanclass="math inline">\(\lambda=i,-i\)</span>，从几何上看：该矩阵的作用是将向量旋转90度，旋转之后的向量不可能与之前的平行，所以也就没有实数特征值。</p><h2 id="对角化">对角化</h2><p>这一节的前提是<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span><strong>有<spanclass="math inline">\(n\)</span>个线性无关的特征向量</strong>，这样后面由<strong>特征向量组成的矩阵</strong><spanclass="math inline">\(S\)</span>才可逆。<br />对于满足前提的矩阵： <span class="math display">\[AS=A\begin{bmatrix}x_1&amp;...&amp;

\text{}\\C+2D=2&amp; \text{}\\C+3D=2&amp; \text{}\\\end{cases}\]</span> 矩阵形式： <span class="math display">\[Ax=\begin{bmatrix}   1 &amp; 1\\   1 &amp; 2\\   1 &amp; 3\\  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}   C\\  D\\  \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}   1\\   2\\     2\\  \end{bmatrix}=b  \]</span> 显然是无解的，要找到最优拟合系数<spanclass="math inline">\(CD\)</span>，就要用到投影：清除outlier(离群值)后，定义每个点的误差：<spanclass="math inline">\(|e|^2=|Ax-b|^2\)</span>，那么优化目标变为最小化：<spanclass="math inline">\(e_1^2+e_2^2+e_3^2=(C+D-1)^2+(C+2D-2)^2+(C+3D-2)^2\)</span>，如何找到<spanclass="math inline">\(\hatx=\begin{bmatrix}  C\\  D\\  \end{bmatrix}\)</span>?<br />求偏导当然是一种方法，从线性代数的角度，回顾下上节中<spanclass="math inline">\(A^TA\hatx=A^Tb\)</span>，我们已经证明，<strong>这样解得的<spanclass="math inline">\(\hat x\)</span>可以微调<spanclass="math inline">\(b\)</span>使其最靠近<spanclass="math inline">\(C(A)\)</span></strong>，也就是我们要的最优估计。<br />所以我们有： <span class="math display">\[A^TA\hat x=\begin{bmatrix}   3 &amp;

\text{}\\6C+14D=11&amp; \text{}\\\end{cases}\]</span> 解得<spanclass="math inline">\(C=\frac{2}{3},D=\frac{1}{2}\)</span>，我们的最佳拟合直线即为<spanclass="math inline">\(b=\frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{2}t\)</span>。</p><p>最后要注意的一点：<span class="math inline">\(\hatx\)</span>可解的前提是<spanclass="math inline">\(A^TA\)</span>可逆，只要<spanclass="math inline">\(A\)</span>的各列线性无关，这点即可满足。<br />不妨做一些证明：<br />要证明<span class="math inline">\(A^TA\)</span>可逆即证明<spanclass="math inline">\(A^TAx=0\)</span>只有零解；<br /><span class="math inline">\(x^TA^TAx=0,(Ax)^TAx=0,Ax=0\)</span>，<spanclass="math inline">\(A\)</span>的各列线性无关意即<spanclass="math inline">\(Ax=0\)</span>只有零解，得证。</p><h2 id="正交化">正交化</h2><p>我们都知道，对于<strong>标准正交向量</strong>，有： <spanclass="math display">\[q_i^Tq_j=\begin{cases}0&amp; \text{$i\neq j$}\\1&amp; \text{$i=j$}\\\end{cases}\]</span> 正交矩阵写作<span class="math inline">\(Q=\begin{bmatrix}  q_1&amp; q_2 ... &amp; q_n\\  \end{bmatrix}\)</span>，很容易验证： <spanclass="math display">\[Q^TQ=\begin{bmatrix}   q_1^T\\   ...\\     q_n^T\\  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}   q_1 &amp; ... &amp; q_n\\  \end{bmatrix}=I\]</span> 如果<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>是方阵，那么<spanclass="math inline">\(Q^T=Q^{-1}\)</span>。正交矩阵的例子有很多：以前学习过的置换矩阵、<spanclass="math inline">\(\begin{bmatrix}  cos\theta &amp;-sin\theta\\  sin\theta &amp;cos\theta\\  \end{bmatrix}\)</span>，还有一种叫做Adhemar的系列矩阵也是正交阵：<spanclass="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}  1 &amp;

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="矩阵消元">矩阵消元</h2><p>求解三元一次方程组<spanclass="math inline">\(Ax=b\)</span>的方法就是<strong>消元</strong>：<span class="math display">\[\begin{cases}x+2y+z=2&amp; \text{E1}\\3x+8y+z=12&amp; \text{E2}\\4y+z=2&amp; \text{E3}\end{cases}\]</span> 用<spanclass="math inline">\(E2-3*E1\)</span>，再用<spanclass="math inline">\(E3-2*E2\)</span>，增广矩阵的变化： <spanclass="math display">\[\begin{bmatrix}   A &amp;

c \\  \end{bmatrix}\]</span> 注意到变换过程中<spanclass="math inline">\(A\)</span>的pivots(主对角线元素)均不为0。<br />接着可以得到消元后的方程组： <span class="math display">\[\begin{cases}x+2y+z=2&amp; \text{}\\2y-2z=6&amp; \text{}\\5z=-10&amp; \text{}\end{cases}\]</span>从最后一个方程解起，并不断<strong>回代</strong>，就可以求得<spanclass="math inline">\((x,y,z)\)</span>的值。</p><p>如果回顾刚才的变换过程，并且用矩阵形式去表示：<br />第一步：将<span class="math inline">\((2,1)\)</span>位置的值变0，即<spanclass="math inline">\(E2-3*E1\)</span>： <span class="math display">\[E_{21}A=\begin{bmatrix}   1 &amp;

2 &amp; -2\\   0 &amp; 4 &amp; 1  \end{bmatrix}  \]</span> 其实这个过程就是对单位阵做相同的行变换得到<spanclass="math inline">\(E_{21}\)</span>，<spanclass="math inline">\(E_{21}\)</span>的第一行乘以<spanclass="math inline">\(A\)</span>本质上就是<spanclass="math inline">\(A\)</span>的各行的线性组合：<spanclass="math inline">\(1*row1+0*row2+0*row3=[1\ 2\1]\)</span>；同样的，<spanclass="math inline">\(E_{21}\)</span>的第二行乘以<spanclass="math inline">\(A\)</span>本质上还是<spanclass="math inline">\(A\)</span>的各行的线性组合：<spanclass="math inline">\(-3*row1+1*row2+0*row3=[0\ 2\ -2]\)</span>...<br />第二步：将<span class="math inline">\((3,2)\)</span>位置的值变0，即<spanclass="math inline">\(E3-2*E2\)</span>： <span class="math display">\[E_{32}(E_{21}A)=\begin{bmatrix}   1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\   0 &amp; -2 &amp; 1  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}   1 &amp; 2 &amp; 1\\   0 &amp; 2 &amp; -2\\   0 &amp; 4 &amp; 1  \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}   1 &amp; 2 &amp; 1\\   0 &amp; 2 &amp; -2\\   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 5  \end{bmatrix}  \]</span> 这个过程就是对单位阵做相同的行变换得到<spanclass="math inline">\(E_{32}\)</span>，<spanclass="math inline">\(E_{32}\)</span>的第三行乘以<spanclass="math inline">\((E_{21}A)\)</span>本质上就是<spanclass="math inline">\((E_{21}A)\)</span>的各行的线性组合：<spanclass="math inline">\(0*row1+(-2*row2)+1*row3=[0\ 0\ 5]\)</span>；所以整个变换过程用矩阵形式表示：<br /><spanclass="math display">\[E_{32}(E_{21}A)=U-&gt;(E_{32}E_{21})A=U(矩阵乘法结合律成立，交换律不成立)\]</span><br />非常重要的结论就是<strong>左行右列</strong>： <spanclass="math display">\[\begin{bmatrix}   1 &amp; 2 &amp; 7\\  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}  row1\\  row2\\  row3  \end{bmatrix}=1*row1+2*row2+7*row3(矩阵左乘向量即行向量的线性组合)  \]</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{bmatrix}   col1 &amp; col2 &amp; col3\\  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}  3\\  4\\  5  \end{bmatrix}=3*col1+4*col2+5*col3(矩阵右乘向量即列向量的线性组合)  \]</span><strong>线性组合</strong>的思想也是矩阵乘法的核心，再举一例： <spanclass="math display">\[\begin{bmatrix}   0 &amp; 1\\   1 &amp; 0\\  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}   a &amp; b\\   c &amp; d\\  \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}   c &amp; d\\   a &amp; b\\  \end{bmatrix}  \]</span> 结果的第一行即：<span class="math inline">\(0*[a\ b]+1*[c\d]\)</span>，第二行即：<span class="math inline">\(1*[a\ b]+0*[c\d]\)</span>，交换行。<br />类似的，交换列(<strong>列向量的线性组合</strong>)： <spanclass="math display">\[\begin{bmatrix}   a &amp; b\\   c &amp; d\\  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}   0 &amp; 1\\   1 &amp; 0\\  \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}   b &amp; a\\   d &amp; c\\  \end{bmatrix}  \]</span></p><h2 id="乘法和逆矩阵">乘法和逆矩阵</h2><p>回顾上一节的内容，对于<spanclass="math inline">\(AB=C\)</span>：<br /><span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>的第<spanclass="math inline">\(i\)</span>列是<spanclass="math inline">\(A\)</span>的列向量的线性组合，组合系数即是<spanclass="math inline">\(B\)</span>对应的列<spanclass="math inline">\(col_i\)</span>，即：<spanclass="math inline">\(A*col_i\)</span>；<br /><span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>的第<spanclass="math inline">\(i\)</span>行是<spanclass="math inline">\(B\)</span>的行向量的线性组合，组合系数即是<spanclass="math inline">\(A\)</span>对应的行<spanclass="math inline">\(row_i\)</span>，即：<spanclass="math inline">\(row_i*B\)</span>。<br />从这点出发，对于任意的矩阵乘法，都可以有： <spanclass="math display">\[AB=\Sigma(col_A*row_B)\]</span> 举例来看： <spanclass="math display">\[\begin{bmatrix}   2 &amp; 7\\   3 &amp; 8\\   4 &amp; 9  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}   1 &amp; 6\\   0 &amp; 0\\  \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}   2\\   3\\   4  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}   1 &amp; 6  \end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}   7\\   8\\   9  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}   0 &amp; 0  \end{bmatrix}  \]</span> 再来看看<span class="math inline">\(A=\begin{bmatrix}  1&amp; 3\\  2 &amp;6\\  \end{bmatrix}\)</span>，能否找到一个<strong>非零向量</strong><spanclass="math inline">\(x\)</span>，使得<spanclass="math inline">\(Ax=0\)</span>呢？<br />答案是肯定的，因为<spanclass="math inline">\(A\)</span>是不可逆的。<br />解决不可逆这种特殊情况之前，先搞定足够好(可逆)的矩阵： <spanclass="math display">\[AA^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}   1 &amp; 3\\   2 &amp; 7\\  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}   a &amp; c\\   b &amp; d\\  \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}   1 &amp; 0\\   0 &amp; 1\\  \end{bmatrix}=I  \]</span> 要求出<spanclass="math inline">\(A^{-1}\)</span>，从列向量线性组合的角度： <spanclass="math display">\[\begin{bmatrix}   1 &amp; 3\\   2 &amp; 7\\  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}   a\\   b\\  \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}   1\\   0\\  \end{bmatrix}，\begin{bmatrix}   1 &amp; 3\\   2 &amp; 7\\  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}   c\\   d\\  \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}   0\\   1\\  \end{bmatrix}  \]</span>此时又回到了消元法解方程组，不过这里我们可以偷个懒，用Gauss-Jordan一次解出2个方程组：<span class="math display">\[\begin{bmatrix}   A &amp; I\\  \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}   1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\   2 &amp; 7 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\  \end{bmatrix}-&gt;\begin{bmatrix}   1 &amp; 0 &amp; 7 &amp; -3\\   0 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1\\  \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}   I &amp; A^{-1}\\  \end{bmatrix}  \]</span>再次回顾上一节的内容：消元过程中所作的变换都可以通过<strong>左乘初等阵</strong>实现，将变换过程中所有初等阵的乘积记作<spanclass="math inline">\(E\)</span>，我们得到了一个激动人心的求解逆矩阵的方法：<span class="math display">\[E\begin{bmatrix}   A &amp; I\\  \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}   I &amp; A^{-1}\\  \end{bmatrix}  \]</span> 因为经过变换，<spanclass="math inline">\(EA=I\)</span>，所以<spanclass="math inline">\(E=A^{-1}\)</span>，比国内的伴随矩阵不知道好到哪里去了。</p><h2 id="a的lu分解">A的LU分解</h2><p>在了解为什么进行LU分解之前，我们先来看看高斯消元的时间复杂度：<br />回想整个过程，如果矩阵<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>有<spanclass="math inline">\(n\)</span>个元素，不难发现耗费的时间<spanclass="math inline">\(n^2+(n-1)^2+...+1^2\approx\frac{n^3}{3}\)</span>，即<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n^3)\)</span>；对于右侧的列向量<spanclass="math inline">\(b(有m个元素)\)</span>，耗费<spanclass="math inline">\(O(m^2)\)</span>。<br />在很多时候，求解<span class="math inline">\(Ax=b\)</span>时矩阵<spanclass="math inline">\(A\)</span>是不变的，只有<spanclass="math inline">\(b\)</span>在变化，如果每次都用消元法去解，每次的复杂度都会是<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n^3)\)</span>，那么如果采用LU分解<spanclass="math inline">\(A=LU\)</span>，只要预先准备好<strong>下三角矩阵</strong><spanclass="math inline">\(L\)</span>和<strong>上三角矩阵</strong><spanclass="math inline">\(U\)</span>，这一步复杂度<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n^3)\)</span>，以后求解时：<spanclass="math inline">\(Ax=LUx=b\)</span>，只要求解：</p><ul><li><span class="math inline">\(Ly=b\)</span>，得到<spanclass="math inline">\(y\)</span>，<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span>；</li><li><span class="math inline">\(Ux=y\)</span>，得到<spanclass="math inline">\(x\)</span>，<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span>。<br />以后每次求解只需要<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span>，大大提高了效率。</li></ul><p>明白了原因后，我们看看具体的过程：<br />我们知道，消元过程中矩阵<spanclass="math inline">\(A\)</span>可以通过左乘矩阵<spanclass="math inline">\(E\)</span>变为上三角矩阵<spanclass="math inline">\(U\)</span>，即<spanclass="math inline">\(EA=U\)</span>，那么<spanclass="math inline">\(A=E^{-1}U=LU\)</span>。<br />举例来看：<br />如果<span class="math inline">\(E_{32}E_{21}A=U\)</span>，那么<spanclass="math inline">\(A=E_{21}^{-1}E_{32}^{-1}U=LU\)</span>，假设<spanclass="math inline">\(E_{32}=\begin{bmatrix}  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\  0&amp; 1 &amp; 0\\  0 &amp; -5 &amp; 1  \end{bmatrix}\)</span>，<spanclass="math inline">\(E_{21}=\begin{bmatrix}  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\  -2&amp; 1 &amp; 0\\  0 &amp; 0 &amp;1  \end{bmatrix}\)</span>，那么求<spanclass="math inline">\(L\)</span>即是求<spanclass="math inline">\(E_{21}^{-1}和E_{32}^{-1}\)</span>，当然可以通过上一节中的拼单位阵来求解，但是对于初等阵，可以不用这么麻烦，以<spanclass="math inline">\(E_{21}^{-1}\)</span>为例：<br />这个变换是<spanclass="math inline">\(row2-2*row1\)</span>，那么<strong>逆矩阵就是要undo这个操作</strong>，即<spanclass="math inline">\(row2+2*row1\)</span>，所以<spanclass="math inline">\(E_{21}^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}  1 &amp; 0 &amp;0\\  2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\  0 &amp; 0 &amp;1  \end{bmatrix}\)</span>，同理可得<spanclass="math inline">\(E_{32}^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}  1 &amp; 0 &amp;0\\  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\  0 &amp; 5 &amp;1  \end{bmatrix}\)</span>，按照<strong>列线性组合</strong>的思想，<spanclass="math inline">\(L=E_{21}^{-1}E_{32}^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}  1 &amp;0 &amp; 0\\  2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\  0 &amp; 5 &amp;1  \end{bmatrix}\)</span>。</p><h2 id="置换">置换</h2><p>前面的消元过程中，当主元为0时，可能需要<strong>交换行</strong>来使消元继续下去，交换行的操作可以通过左乘置换矩阵实现，即<spanclass="math inline">\(PA=LU\)</span>，前提是<spanclass="math inline">\(A\)</span>可逆，否则再怎么交换，都会有零行。<br />3阶矩阵的置换可以有<span class="math inline">\(3!=6\)</span>种： <spanclass="math display">\[\begin{bmatrix}   1 &amp;

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>作为一个局内人，经历了四年的本科教育，后来接触了美帝学校的课程，对比之下越发觉得差距天大。丝毫不夸张地说，随便找一门美帝TOP50学校的公开课，质量都可以吊打国内99%的学校课程。</p><h2 id="重蹈覆辙">重蹈覆辙</h2><p>一届又一届的学生进入高校，被统一的流程加工几年之后扔进市场，工厂会召回次品，但没人会为学生负责，这样的故事仍然在不断上演，以我所在的EE为例：</p><ul><li>四年中要上若干门思政课，并且浪费很多时间去写作业、开会讨论、做pre。XJTU的这些课期末考试都是闭卷，君不见考前的图书馆走廊，到处都是拿着《毛概》笔记认真背书的同学，我曾经也是其中的一员，看似司空见惯的事情现在想来真的非常荒诞。</li><li>每学期动辄10几门课、30几个学分。大三的第一学期堆积了5门硬核专业课，外加电设和FPGA实验，以及不知道为什么存在的金工实习，更遑论还有选修课。这样的培养方案使得学生根本没有时间和精力仔细钻研，能应付完平时作业、大作业和期末考已经不易。</li><li>更为严重的是：专业课上时常可以见到PPTReader般的老师，往往这类老师对签到这种事情非常在乎，好像在维护自己的权威，除了这些，看不出他/她对课程有什么见解。PPT往往都是10几年前的版本，排版、错别字惨不忍睹，就这样一代代流传下来，还是在EE/CS这样更新极快的学科中。至今记忆犹新的微机原理的某个女老师，上课总是在炫耀自己去THU学习人家的计组课程，要做一台计算机云云...这位老师上课时竟然将汇编程序的后缀写作<code>.acm</code>。。。</li><li>关于实验课，更是无力吐槽，你的成绩基本取决于实验报告的长度，所以内卷之风日益兴起，甚至一个小小的物理实验，有同学写出了20多页的报告。。。试想如果老师仔细评阅每份报告，自然不会按照长度打分，但是老师还要忙着做很多重要的事情，怎么会有时间呢？</li></ul><p>这样的结果就是本科学的东西考完试就还回去了，下次要用还得重新学，浪费几倍的时间重新学习，这也是我最讨厌的地方。</p><h2 id="追根溯源">追根溯源</h2><p>曾经我觉得：本科教育的失败只是某个学校做的不好，也可能只是西部高校做得不够好，可是随着很多很多不可思议的事情发生，我开始怀疑即使是顶尖大学也会烂到一塌糊涂。如果你有兴趣搜索这些内容，你会看到哪怕THU、SJTU这些国内名校也是如此，只是恶劣的程度有所不同而已。所以我一直觉得交大在我黄金般的4年里没起到什么作用，甚至起的是负面作用，我没有斯德哥尔摩情节，不会感谢学校提供了如此巨大的阻力，是为了锻炼学生。</p><ul><li>本科教育并不会影响职称评定，没有相应的考核要求，不如灌paper、拉项目来的实在。教学评估也是可笑，只会评估课堂出勤率高不高、实验报告写得长不长，压根不会有领导在乎课堂质量。</li><li>钱，还是钱：我上过Harvard的计算机导论课，整个课程有70+TA，还有Amazon的计算资源免费支持，这样精心设计的课程怎么可能不是翘楚？</li></ul><h2 id="惩前毖后">惩前毖后</h2><p>怪不得在《上海交通大学学生生存手册》中，有学长疾呼：</p><blockquote><p>国内绝大部分大学的本科教育，不是濒临崩溃，而是早已崩溃。</p></blockquote><p>我自己意识到这一点实在太晚，穷屌丝也读不起master::&gt;_&lt;::<br />我很感谢国家的政策，让我掏很少的钱就能接触到大学教育。但是希望赶路者能意识到：国内的高等教育就是shit，如果按照学校的计划走下来，进社会迟早被安排地明明白白，越努力，越傻逼。</p><p>Sad buttrue，研究生的教育只会更加差劲，我不想再被继续残害下去，说说自己的打算(在达到毕业要求的前提下)：</p><ul><li>我不否认有大神可以从课堂上学会关键知识，但是对于我们普通人来说，只能把有限的时间用来做出最好的选择。适合自己的方式才是最好的。</li><li>能不去的课就不去了，尽量选水课(不签到/考试水/给分高)。用尽可能多的<strong>自由支配时间</strong>学习更加优质的教学资源。</li><li>和老师交流要看情况，主要还是科研方向问题。</li></ul><h2

      <link href="/posts/inflation/"/>
      <url>/posts/inflation/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>虽然以前辅修过金融学，但是对于许多内容还是一知半解，也很难形成体系。最近又看了一些资料，就作为笔记记录在此。</p><h2 id="定义">定义</h2><p>Wikipedia对于通货膨胀的定义是：</p><blockquote><p>In economics, inflation is a sustained increase in the general pricelevel of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. Whenthe general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goodsand services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in thepurchasing power per unit of money - a loss of real value in the mediumof exchange and unit of account within the economy.</p></blockquote><p>直观来看，就是因为货币发行量大于实际流通中所需的货币量，单位货币购买力下降，<strong>物价持续上升</strong>。<br />那么印多少钱合适呢？有这样一个式子： <spanclass="math display">\[流通中所需的货币量=\frac{商品价格总额}{流通次数}\]</span>举例来看：A用1元买了B的面包，B用这一元买了C的牛奶，C用这一元买了A的水果。面包、牛奶、水果的价格总额是3元，流通了3次，所以实际只需要1元就够了。</p><h2 id="作用">作用</h2><p>适当的通胀率(可以用CPI衡量)是可以促进经济发展的，比如适当的物价上涨，你当然希望立即就去购买商品，而不是等它涨价之后再去购买，这样就刺激了经济发展。<br />相反，如果通胀很严重(一般认为大于2%)，尤其是想要通过货币超发刺激经济(货币型通胀)，控制不好就可能成为下一个津巴布韦。<br />再来看看国内的一些例子：2008年全球经济危机，中国为了保持经济高速增长，向市场投放4万亿，货币供给大量增加，所以我总感觉08年之后物价就涨得有点快~地方政府为了拉动GDP，房价一路飙升。大家买不起？没关系，首付少一些，银行多放些贷款，过量放贷导致物价上升。</p><h2 id="例子">例子</h2><p>我们都知道：商品买的人越多，越火，价格也就越高。投机商就会借机涌入市场，因为即使不是刚需，我也可以买一些，等以后涨了再卖出去，这样就可以赚取差价套利。<br />随着刚需和投机商的大量涌入，需求持续增加，远远大于供给，价格继续增长。<br />涨到很多人凭个人收入都买不起，不论刚需还是投机者钱都不够了，怎么办？<br />贷款。<br />银行钱也不够了，怎么办？<br />开印钞机，大家需求这么旺盛，拉动经济的大好机会。<br />大家都有了钱，泡沫持续繁荣，价格越来越高，自己腰包里的钱没有涨，怎么办？只能自己少出一点，多向银行借点，这样等到超出个人的偿还能力，就是<strong>次贷</strong>。<br />地方政府、开发商和投机者赚得盆满钵满，大家一看，卧槽这么赚钱，都把钱扔进了房地产，制造业被挤压的没有生存空间。<br />当房价到顶，大家都绝望的时候，投机商就开始抛售，供给增加，需求减少，价格下跌，这很可能引发经济断崖式下跌，GDP没有了，银行的贷款无法收回，完蛋。<br />那么所谓的软着陆是什么？<br />银行不准借给投机者，刚需的如果不还钱，加入黑名单。还要多把钱借给刚需，如果价格下跌，刚需的钱一定可以收回来。限购令、交税都是为了限制投机商进入。<br />但是房价还不能跌得太快，怎么办？刺激刚需：买房有补贴，首付继续降低。什么？这样还不买，好，不买房的不给上户口，子女不能上学，于是就只能为国接盘，谁的利益受到了损害，这是很明显的事情。这部分需求填补了投机者退出去的那部分，需求还在，就不会暴跌。渐渐地，泡沫消失，一切回归正常。但是这损害了未来的消费能力，再加上老龄化社会到来，前景不容乐观。</p><p><ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/19894997/answer/123847049">参考链接</a></p>]]></content>

      <title>Egg Dropping Puzzle</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-two-egg-problem">The Two Egg Problem</h2><p>曾经是Google的一道经典题。<br />题意：有一个百层高楼，鸡蛋在<spanclass="math inline">\(L\)</span>层及以下扔都不碎，在<spanclass="math inline">\(L\)</span>层以上都会碎。现在某人有<spanclass="math inline">\(k\)</span>个鸡蛋，问在<strong>最坏情况下</strong>，至少扔多少次(用<spanclass="math inline">\(m\)</span>表示)可以确定<spanclass="math inline">\(L\)</span>的值。<br />分析：先来考虑<spanclass="math inline">\(k=1\)</span>的情况。只有1个鸡蛋，为了得到一个确定的<spanclass="math inline">\(L\)</span>，只能从第一层开始，逐渐尝试增加楼层高度，因此<spanclass="math inline">\(m=100\)</span>时，无论<spanclass="math inline">\(L\)</span>的值是多少，都可以被确定。<br />再来考虑<spanclass="math inline">\(k=\infty\)</span>的情况。这种情况就变为了binarysearch的问题，先拿一个在50层扔，如果碎，则在25层扔；如果不碎，则在75层扔...即<spanclass="math inline">\(m=7\)</span>。<br />最后来考虑<span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span>的情况。因为<spanclass="math inline">\(k=1\)</span>只能一层一层试，所以第一个鸡蛋应该尽可能缩小搜索空间，但是如果第一个鸡蛋的楼层间隔太小(比如在2层、4层...)，无疑会增加<spanclass="math inline">\(m\)</span>。不妨取第一个鸡蛋在10层、20层...，共10次；假如第一个在10层没碎，在20碎了，那么第二个鸡蛋可以尝试11、12...19，共9次；故<spanclass="math inline">\(m=19\)</span>。<br />上面方案的问题在于：如果临界楼层比较高，那么第二个鸡蛋的次数是确定的，但第一个就需要多试几次，总次数就会增加。<br />那么如何使得不论临界楼层在哪，<spanclass="math inline">\(m\)</span>的值都不会波动呢？<br />很简单，只要第一个多扔一次，确定的范围(第二个要试的次数)减小，总次数就会均衡。<br />对于第一个鸡蛋，第一次在<spanclass="math inline">\(a\)</span>层扔，如果不碎，第二次向上增加<spanclass="math inline">\(a-1\)</span>层...直到最后只向上增加<spanclass="math inline">\(1\)</span>层：<spanclass="math inline">\(a+(a-1)+...+1\geq100\)</span>，故<spanclass="math inline">\(a\geq13.7\)</span>。<br />鸡蛋一：在14层、27层、39层、50层、60层、69层、77层、84层、90层、95层、99层、100层扔，共12次；<br />鸡蛋二：如果蛋一在14层碎了，蛋二要扔13次，共14次；如果蛋一在27层碎了，蛋二要扔12次，共14次...故<spanclass="math inline">\(m=14\)</span>。</p><h2 id="super-egg-problem">Super Egg Problem</h2><p>对于<spanclass="math inline">\(k=2\)</span>，我们有了一个比较好的解决方案。那么现在有<spanclass="math inline">\(k\)</span>个鸡蛋，楼高<spanclass="math inline">\(n\)</span>层，<ahref="https://leetcode.com/problems/super-egg-drop/">问题</a>(记作<spanclass="math inline">\(m(k,n)\)</span>)又该如何解决？<br /><span class="math inline">\(k=1\)</span>和<spanclass="math inline">\(n=1\)</span>的情况比较简单： |n1|2|3|4|...||--|--|--|--|--|--| |1|1|1|1|1| |2|2| |3|3| |...| |那么如果我们递归地思考：任选一层<spanclass="math inline">\(h\)</span>扔第一个鸡蛋，无非有碎和不碎2种情况：<br />碎：临界楼层在1~h之间，问题规模缩小为<spanclass="math inline">\(m(k-1,h-1)\)</span>；<br />不碎：临界楼层在h~n之间，问题规模缩小为<spanclass="math inline">\(m(k,n-h)\)</span>。<br />所以：<span class="math inline">\(m_h(k,n)=1+max\{m(k-1,h-1),m(k,n-h)\}\)</span>。<br />对于<spanclass="math inline">\(h\)</span>，可以采用枚举的方法，计算<spanclass="math inline">\(m_h(k,n)\)</span>，在其中选出一个最小的值，故问题得到解决：<span class="math display">\[m(k,n)=min\{m_h(k,n)\},h=1,2,...n\]</span>Base Case就是<span class="math inline">\(k=1\)</span>和<spanclass="math inline">\(n=1\)</span>。<br />时间复杂度<span class="math inline">\(O(KN^2)\)</span>，空间复杂度<spanclass="math inline">\(O(KN)\)</span>。<br />记忆化递归：</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Solution</span> &#123;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="title">superEggDrop</span><span class="params">(<span class="keyword">int</span> K, <span class="keyword">int</span> N)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">        vector&lt;vector&lt;<span class="keyword">int</span>&gt;&gt;

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“支教是我一直以来一个小小的梦想，我渴望告诉孩子们外面的世界，渴望让他们学会感恩，学会如何去爱。”</p><p>大一暑假，爱心社面试中，我如是说道。</p><p>之所以对支教有如此深的执念，大概是由于我真切地体会过教育资源的不公，体会过乡镇学校与城市学校巨大的差距吧。</p><p>抛开师资以及硬件设施，单就视野而言，乡镇的学生就已经错失了很多机会，也许你在某一方面有些天赋，但却没有触碰的可能。有的人已经凭借出色的OI成绩保送时，我却不知道什么是信息学竞赛；有的人通过自主招生降分录取时，我才发现自己无处准备，乏善可陈。</p><p>而现在，我一定尽力把精彩的世界展现给他们，用“科技之光”和“趣味地理”两个主题唤起孩子们的向往，激励他们去努力。</p><p>对我而言，支教的目的并不在于教会孩子们每道题目的解法，而是要在他们幼小的心里埋下一颗种子，一颗梦想、未来与希望的种子。哪怕将来只有一粒种子生根、发芽，我也觉得不枉此行。</p><p>我从未思考“支教有意义吗”这样的问题，因为</p><p><strong>很多事情需要你亲身经历，才能找到其中的意义。</strong></p><hr /><p>回来之后写的总结</p><h2 id="心之所向-即是光亮">心之所向 即是光亮</h2><blockquote><p>——XXX初中支教总结</p><p>此去有泪，了无遗憾。转眼就是三天，此刻，在透亮舒心的图书馆，我一遍遍忆起你们的样子，也回味着自己的影子，我想用最华丽的篇章来写下属于我们的故事。</p><p>能一步步走到今天，得感谢曾在我生命中闪亮、发光的每个人。他们有的，我清楚地知道是谁，什么关系，而有的我甚至都叫不上名字，留下的也许只有一抹瞬间，一个背影。他们闯进你的生命里，然后转身匆匆就走。颇具戏剧性的是，我可能连偿还他们的机会都不曾有过。所以我唯一可以做的就是：怀着一颗感恩的心，将这份爱心传承下去，这大概就是人生的意义所在了吧。</p><p>幸运的是，上天没有辜负我的心愿；而我，亦没有辜负自己。</p><p>史乡虽小，却足够温馨。我们自己“筑巢”，赶集买菜；掐着手表上课，生怕错过每一分的精髓；笑着和你们打闹，生怕留下一丢丢的隔阂……</p><p>素质拓展，我体验到了如此强大的班级凝聚力。扬起的灰尘，只是我们荡漾青春的背景；燥热的酷夏，带给我们永无止境的激情。一站到底，我感受到了如此强烈的知识渴求。能载着你们遨游知识的海洋，领略大千世界，很欣慰，很幸福。联欢会，我无语凝噎，只好用心倾听，倾听你们欢歌下隐藏的淡淡的哀伤。</p><p>所幸，我见证了一切。见证了史乡之夜，你们那么努力地写下自己的心愿，载着孔明灯，渐飞向那天际。你们可曾知道：用梦想点缀的夜空有多么浪漫吗？见证了细雨之下，我们那么温馨地挤入同一把小伞，漫步在湿滑的街边。你们可曾知道：这么温情的陪伴有多么感人吗？见证了篝火晚会，我们那么嘶哑地唱着班歌，伴着声声蝉鸣，飘向广阔的麦田。你们又可曾知道：这么真实的倾诉有多么难得吗？</p><p>故事很多，却不敢一一道来，因为我怕自己陷入回忆的漩涡而难以自拔。短暂的时光，我甚至不曾来得及想象别离。不知道我的心愿是否给你们带去了哪怕一丝丝光亮，史乡的我们很幸福，但我不想只是怀念你们那时的笑靥，我更渴望看到你们未来的欢喜。</p><p>我讨厌离别，但故事却终将结束。如果，这段相遇的过往是岁月的恩赐，那么，你们，一定是上苍派来的最美的天使。虽然我从未见过天使，但我想，你们就是她在人间的名字。当最后，我们的眼泪不约而同地掉落，我许下了承诺：不久就重逢。愿那时，也遇到同样美好的你们。</p><p>生命的长度很难去拓展，但宽度却由我们自己决定。支教不过一个小小的心愿，但其蕴含的精神震撼却挥之不去，深深烙在了脑海。</p><p>“真正的平静，不是远离车马喧嚣，而是在心中修篱种菊。”这短暂而又漫长的生活，当生活赋予无限的压力时，当痛苦悄然降临时，愿我也能守住自我，守住内心。对我而言，公益的脚步从未停止，我想趁着年轻，尽情绽放！</p></blockquote>支教期间写的推送：<br /><ahref="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MzUxMjA5Ng==∣=2649929900&amp;idx=2&amp;sn=6e36434e4664cd3e82912240136679f7&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=1027ug4p7BJeIVmoWGS73wpX#rd">【弦歌史乡】许你夜空中最亮的星</a><br /><ahref="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MzUxMjA5Ng==∣=2649929882&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=4ae30cb4c297a7abac52c2b9a2ecbaef&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=10270FdciDePyzqf4Fu4wD8T#rd">【弦歌史乡】许你夜空中最亮的星</a><br />小伙伴们写的 <ahref="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MzUxMjA5Ng==∣=2649929840&amp;idx=2&amp;sn=633f9339c32983a3cee2004e63bef309&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=1031zCbbE172mOWeZKj4vUId#rd">【手拉手系列】弦歌史乡</a><br /><ahref="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MzUxMjA5Ng==∣=2649929845&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=2550b5901dcbcf939132c8314d83fb5d&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=1031SLclYWY2gEysGRqYqkZ0#rd">【弦歌史乡】惟愿给你们最缤纷的万花筒</a><br /><ahref="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MzUxMjA5Ng==∣=2649929855&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=e3526c7cea74f4e29f1946c0d50fd109&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=1031Q7f8QOZm9TskDsELKKHD#rd">【弦歌史乡】放眼看世界</a><br /><ahref="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MzUxMjA5Ng==∣=2649929858&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=94eed8f13d7b6e3445c7e677377c58e3&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=1031tbnwMYimOjyxMvigSkg6#rd">【弦歌史乡】《哥哥姐姐们，请你们不要再来支教了》之问</a><br /><ahref="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MzUxMjA5Ng==∣=2649929873&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=89047f782ca2d10d4954cc2aba42d3b6&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=1031YjO6PqJX7cik00q5zMZ4#rd">【弦歌史乡】风雨无阻，我们陪你们回家</a><br /><ahref="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MzUxMjA5Ng==∣=2649929900&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=eb3445881fe1d1a13662ae097afcb0de&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=1031KbjExxgjiPZrkIhPqgVD#rd">【弦歌史乡】如果我们不曾相遇</a><br /><ahref="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MzUxMjA5Ng==∣=2649929904&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=efb1e2807e0527791e101435a74b2bb8&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=1031dPimn6zynOREw3CoOA3r#rd">【弦歌史乡】离而欢歌</a><br /><p align="right">写于2017年11月1日，知乎</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="1.png" />以前，觉得自己是因为单纯喜欢足球这项运动，所以才会一直坚持去踢。</p><p>后来，逐渐处于“半退役”状态时，才体会到“兄弟”一词于我的意义。</p><p>高一开始接触足球，然而并没有一见钟情，只是当做普通的体育课去完成。</p><p>那年巴西世界杯，用手机看文字直播，糟心极了。也说不清喜欢哪个队，只知道德国和西班牙很厉害。</p><p>高二下学期，偶然的机会，从乒乓石台偷偷遛到球场，落日的余晖下，打进一球，彻底点燃了我对足球的热情，从此一发不可收拾，结下了难解之缘。<img src="2.png" alt="美妙的足球场" />曾在滂沱的大雨中，注视着足球，卷带着雨水，缓缓窜进球门，我们相佣而呼，忘情庆祝；也曾在似火的的骄阳里，与汗水共舞，祈求一丝微风，带走难耐的酷热……</p><p>念念不忘那场7:1的巅峰，横扫高三四班的荣耀。上场前的不自信，场边的呐喊助威，场上的互相呼应，整个班级凝聚得令人生畏，我们不惜体力地跑动围抢，仿佛是用生命在战斗。</p><p>进球的场景已经略显模糊，只记得中场有一脚逆天的左脚吊射，让所有人瞠目；</p><p>我通过一粒点球上演了“职业生涯”第一次帽子戏法，7:0。</p><p>老师在最后时刻接门将长传，禁区角左脚凌空爆射破门，一脚“天外飞仙”将比分定格为了7:1，那粒进球被我们啧啧称道了整整一年，直至毕业以后。</p><p>比赛结束以后，我很激动，前所未有的激动，很想去拥抱兄弟们，感谢他们的努力。之后的生物课根本没怎么听课，脑子里全是胜利的喜悦。<img src="3.png" alt="仅存的足球记忆" />那些简单而又纯粹的岁月里，买不起专业的球鞋，也没有华丽的配合，比赛中踢出一个简单的二过一都会回味很久很久。突破、盘带、射门，都没有系统地训练，我们有的，只是一腔热血。<img src="4.png" alt="当年的球鞋" />旺盛的精力至今想来都很可怕，我们可以不吃不喝，从中午12点一直踢到晚上9点。传球、射门、分边，下底传中、突破过人，浪费了好机会之后，也会“开飞机”谢罪，丝毫感受不到疲倦。</p><p>一年多的时间里，玩坏了好几个球，足球几乎是那个时候最爱的放松活动。</p><p>很难形容喜爱到了什么程度，晚上睡觉都在想着该怎么传球。早操后最喜欢讨论的不是数理题目，而是国际足坛谁最厉害。</p><p>也曾通宵去看西班牙国家德比，三个人挤在一张床上，巴萨2:1赢了皇马，感慨苏亚雷斯的强大以及布拉沃的神勇，第二天早起昏昏沉沉去吃早饭的样子还历历在目。</p><p>总是在班级的报纸上寻找关于足球的新闻，仅有的几本足球杂志不知道翻了多少遍，成为了午饭时唯一的消遣。</p><p>后来无数次想要重拾那感觉，却再也找不回来了。不论是重回高中的球场，亦或是穿上高端的球鞋，还是拥有高水平的队友……<img src="5.png" alt="重回高中球场" />后来快要毕业之际，我们买了四件皇马球衣，两黑两白，甚是吸引目光。</p><hr /><p>我们，也曾少年！</p><p>唉！这tmd的青春啊！</p><p>不由得又想起了之前的一个故事</p><blockquote><p>十多年前，我读高中，同桌是个安静漂亮的姑娘，很是喜欢我，但也许是启蒙过晚的原因，我对她熟视无睹，我唯一的爱好就是踢球，而她唯一的爱好就是看我踢球......</p><p>我当时非常喜欢德国队，不厌其烦地向她灌输金色轰炸机如何厉害，哈斯勒如何牛逼，虽然她听不懂，但还是安安静静地看着我，眼含笑意。</p><p>时光荏苒，当德国队折戟法国世界杯的那个夏天，我高三已经快毕业了，临别那天，我送了一张克林斯曼的明信片给她，她满心欢喜，毕竟三年来我第一次送她东西......</p><p>慢慢的，克林斯曼从球员变成了教练，我大学毕业、工作、应酬，整日在推杯换盏中虚与委蛇，不知不觉间很多人和事情都已淡忘，只有看球的时候偶尔也会想起当年同桌的她。</p><p>去年春节回家，无事可做，决定去踢踢球，结果没跑几步就气喘吁吁，索性坐在场边看其他人踢，看了一会儿，视线被一个身穿德国队18号球衣的孩子吸引了，感觉这孩子盘带、传球很有章法，趁那孩子休息的时候，我主动过去和他攀谈起来。</p><p>“踢得不错嘛，几岁了？”</p><p>“8岁了。”</p><p>“踢这么好，平时没少踢吧？”</p><p>“平时没怎么踢，我爸爸不喜欢我踢球，说踢球没用。”</p><p>我一愣，顿时接不上话，气氛显得有些沉闷，我换了个话题。</p><p>“你喜欢德国队？”</p><p>“嗯。”</p><p>“那你最喜欢德国队哪个球星？”</p><p>“克林斯曼。”他不假思索地回答道。</p><p>“嘿，你也知道克林斯曼啊？”我顿时来了兴致。</p><p>他骄傲地回答：“当然了，我妈妈有一张他的明信片，她说克林斯曼是金色轰炸机......”</p></blockquote><p align="right">写于2018年1月20日，知乎</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>无数的回忆，却不知怎么讲起。</p><p>生命中黄金般的三年留在了那里，留在了教室、食堂，留在了操场、水房。丁香台的幽怨、风范楼的纪念……时间逝去的了无痕迹。<br />暮去朝来，脑海里的记忆渐成碎片，模糊，远去……可青春残存的余温却不时袭来，让人不知所措。<br />难吃的饭菜，打水的长队，漫长的台阶，无尽的作业，这被吐槽的一切，我该怎样留住？</p><p>恍惚的日子里，我们沐浴着初春的阳光，穿着蓝白色的校服，三三两两，去清扫校门口的垃圾，飞舞的塑料袋好像永远都跟你作对，高一的卫生红旗班总也不是我们。<br />刚入学的我们难脱稚气，宿舍的卧谈会不知道开到了几点，三国杀也总是通宵通宵地玩。体育课后的历史课，简直是睡觉的天堂，老师略显无奈，不过并没有人care。</p><p>二年级的教室并没有变化，我一度觉得无聊。清洁区变到了教室后面，仲夏的中午拿着笤帚，扫扫松针，偶尔会有几片落叶，倒也非常惬意呢！<br />学习任务貌似重了一些，感觉大家更加熟悉和融洽了。让我印象颇深的两件事：一是教师节那天，国旗下的演讲。莫名其妙地成了要演讲的人，没见过那么大场面，所以提前一周就在准备，演讲稿不知道背了几百遍，周天的晚自习啥也没干，盯着看了两节课，手心直冒汗。第二天上台慷慨激昂地背完了稿子，也算是没给班级丢人；二是期中考试后的家长会，教室装扮着气球，彩带，音乐竟然是“爸爸去哪了”，老师，家长，学生共处一室，感觉其乐融融，真的很温馨。。。<br />搬出了宿舍，租房子住倒也安静。不过院里大部分都认识，还是会经常“联谊”。<br />之后文理分科，学业考试，有走的人，也有来的。下学期有了竞赛培训，很喜欢翘掉晚自习，溜出教室去听数学竞赛。</p><p>高三搬到了更靠近后花园——骊山的风范楼，体育课很方便咯。大家时间紧张，所以楼后面的空地自然成了最佳锻炼地。课间的羽毛球，足球，跳绳略显疯狂啊！<br />学校要求冬天早晨跑早操，真的是感人肺腑，无语凝噎。纵然好多领导（LuXiang，WangJian）监督，还是有人去厕所或者蹲着系鞋带。。。跑完冻如狗，回到异常温暖的教室，再吃点夹馍，零食什么的，早读只能睡过去了。<br />相对来说，我更喜欢广播体操。悠闲的大课间，上个厕所，晃到操场，晒晒太阳，活动一下筋骨。下来时候还能聊聊天，打打闹闹，也算是“偷得浮生半日闲”了。</p><p>每次考完试，操场就变为了乐园，火爆程度超乎想象。在球场奔跑，听着风的声音，跑累了就躺下来看天，看云，看夕阳，考试的阴影一扫而光，那是我最开心的时刻之一。大家会一起玩到很晚，“下山”去吃东西。<br />很喜欢坐在教室靠窗的位置，呼吸几口新鲜的空气，压抑感瞬间消失，上课扭过头就是小树小花。下雪的日子还可以赏景，雪景可美了！<br />贴几张喜欢的～<br /><img src="1.png" /><br /><img src="2.png" /><br /><img src="3.png" /><br /><img src="4.png" /><br />毕业之后，学校就升级成陕西省示范高中了（也算是没有辜负我们为了迎接检查，频繁打扫卫生啊）。<br />虽然实力有限，水平不高，经费不足，饭菜难吃（母校就是我们自己随便黑，却决不允许外人说一句闲话的神奇地方），但进步可见，未来可期！<br />给帅气无敌，宛若天仙的母校再次打call～<br /><img src="5.png" /><br /><img src="6.png" /><br /><img src="7.png" /><br /><img src="8.png" /><br /><img src="9.png" alt="快毕业喽" /><br /><img src="10.png" /><br />纵观这三年，奋斗的时光恍如昨日。从学习结果的角度来说，我无疑是失败的。但论人格的成熟，收获的友谊，价值观的塑造，我又觉得自己是无比幸运的。很多老师的教诲至今仍然记忆犹新，也许会受益终身：</p><blockquote><p>1，不被嘲笑的梦想不值得被实现。<br />2，高考并不会决定什么，但它必定会成为你人生当中的分水岭。<br />3，......</p></blockquote>逝去的岁月没有人能抓住，不论你多么眷恋，亦或有多少遗憾，都要藏在心底，因为前路漫漫！<br />以后若有人问起你的青春，你大可以掰着手指，细数学校曾经的沧桑，拾起被风吹落的故事，那是你私藏的幸福！<br /><p align="right">写于2017年10月16日，知乎</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>这部2006年上映的作品豆瓣评分9.3，时至今日仍然有人乐此不疲地讨论剧情和启发，我想称之为经典应该不算过分。<br />这部剧我至少完整看过3遍，随着阅历增加，对某些角色的体会也变得更深刻。</p><h2 id="许三多">许三多</h2><p>许三多是幸福的。从老马、史今到袁朗，他的成长，总有贵人相助，再加上自身近乎于偏执地努力，成为“兵王”并非意外。<br /><strong>每个开始，总会艰难一些。</strong><br />初来乍到，面对自家坦克，他举手投降，连长怒了。于是，红三连，五班。<br />就像初入社会，没什么朋友，周围的东西和我们格格不入，许三多的境遇大抵如此了。<br />那个“无数班长的坟墓，所有孬兵的天堂”，他活得很简单、很纯粹：负重跑步、整理内务，日日如此，还为连队修了条路。<br /><strong>无人问津的地方，你有得选择。</strong>你可以放弃，可以混日子；也可以认真，可以努力。<br />重回钢七连，仍然没有人相信他，除了班长，那个有过承诺的班长。<br />说实话，那个时候，我讨厌许三多。讨厌他的愚笨，讨厌他不争气，最讨厌的，他拖垮了史今。<br />史今的心思全部倾注给了许三多，那么优秀的班长，在天安门前抱头痛哭，怎叫人不心疼！<br />有人说，史今给许三多打好了地基，袁朗则在地基上盖好了房子。<br />是的，没有史今，就不会有后来的许三多。<br />333个腹部绕杠，许三多开始了自己的蜕变。<br />七连改编，他又把“不抛弃，不放弃”诠释到了极致。<br />不焦虑，耐得住寂寞。<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200316141449843.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />在最绝望的情况下，在完全失去理想和希望的情况下，也会尽自己最大的努力。<br />失手杀掉毒贩，他也怀疑过自己，怀疑过这支部队，因为他相信人性本善，每个人都可以好好活。<br />不过历经波折，最终还是艰难地完成了心智的转变。<br />无意批评，许三多是好兵，但他绝非将才。可能与他成长的家庭有关，父亲的教育方式让他绝对服从、勇于认错，但他缺乏思考。<br />没有思考，就没有大局观；没有大局观，自然不能指挥别人。</p><h2 id="吴哲">吴哲</h2><p>吴哲我比较喜欢，尽管被塑造得稍稍理想了些。<br />年少有为，技术出众。<br />他对自己有着清醒的认识，对这个世界同样如此。<br />一如演习后他对袁朗所说：</p><blockquote><p>我成为不了他，而他亦取代不了我。</p></blockquote><p>不会畏惧权威，永远坚持理想。<br />当他发现现实环境与期望之所相距甚远，他会质疑、会抗议，会去维护自己的理想。<br />理想让他仰望星空，“平常心”使他脚踏实地。<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200316141511696.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />附上袁朗的点评</p><blockquote><p>我不会践踏你们的理想和希望，我不能，因为那是我最珍惜的部分，也是我选择你们的第一要素，我只是想，你们在没有这些东西的情况下也能生存，在更加真实和残酷的环境里还能生存。<br />我敬佩一位老军人，他说他费尽心血却不敢妄谈胜利，他只想他的部下能在战场上少死几个，他说这是军人的人道。<br />这个人略显轻浮，但心理稳重。坚持自己的原则，充满希望和乐观。重要的是，他能跟许三多这样的兵交朋友，这一点，就不会毁于他很容易产生的优越感。</p></blockquote><h2 id="袁朗">袁朗</h2><p>最完美的人，也是无数人想成为的人。<br />他似乎总是站在上帝视角，洞悉一切，指点迷津。<br />军事素养拔尖，一举枪，便打掉了成才的狙击梦。<br />有能力、有思想，也有情义。<br />老A选拔的最后，伍六一放弃，我明明看到了袁朗强忍的泪水。许三多决定复员，他并不是强行挽留。给他钱，给他假，给他自由，我想，这么做，他心里是有底的。<br />演习评估的剧情，异常精彩。袁朗手术刀般精准地评价了每个人，他看得透他们。<br />“不抛弃，不放弃”，他理解的深刻得多。正因为如此，他给了成才第二次机会；也正因为如此，才有了许三多坠落后，他对成才说的话：</p><blockquote><p>百万大军数年心血，人走人留，抛家舍业，一切数据和非数据的结果都要在这几天检验，最后得不出一个公平的结果，因为我的战士要在战场上和他的朋友重拾友谊。<br />你开始珍惜，可你真懂珍惜了吗？不抛弃，不放弃，你倒记住了，你也这样告诉许三多，那么先想想，做到这六个字的人抛弃了什么，放弃了什么。想吧，现在。</p></blockquote><p>初次看这段，我也一脸懵逼。<br />后来才知，许三多为了胜利付出了鲜血，他创造的机会才是真正值得珍惜的，抓住机会获取胜利、为军队改革提供经验，远比立刻抢救队友意义重大的多。<br />他循循善诱，告诉成才一个指挥官应该做什么，告诉他战场上应该怎样取舍。<br />袁朗说自己年轻时最像成才，比吴哲更专心，比成才更知道自己想要什么。<br />我想，袁朗最终也算是给自己找到了接班人吧。<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200316140043328.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2020031614005371.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /></p><h2 id="成才">成才</h2><p>相比之下，成才的路的确坎坷的多。<br />经历了荣光，也熬过了低谷，最后做到了出众。<br />这个人物塑造地很真实，他会为了个人利益抛弃战友，但也会在需要理智时做出正确选择，而许三多感情用事更多一些，这在战场上是致命的，尤其对于指挥官而言。<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/202003161416111.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />袁朗曾经对他寄予厚望，但演习后一切似乎又戛然而止：</p><blockquote><p>你老把一切当成你的对立，总想征服一切，费了这么大的力，我们只想在你们没有战争的时候，就经历第一场战争。战争中伤亡最重的总是新兵，因为没有心理经历，没有适应时间。<br />理由你太见外，任何个人和团体很难在你的心里占到一席之地。你很活跃，也很有能力，但你很封闭，你总是在自己的世界里，想自己的，做自己的。成才，我们这伙人不只是为了对抗，你的战友，甚至你的敌人，需要你去理解、融洽和经历。<br /><strong>你经历的每个地方、每个人、每件事，都需要你付出时间和生命，可你从来没付出感情，你总是冷冰冰的把它们扔掉，那你的努力是为了什么？为一个结果虚耗人生？</strong>你该想的不是怎么成为一个特种兵，是善待自己做好普通一兵。<br />七连只是你的一个过路的地方，如果再有更好的去处，这儿也是你过路的地方，我们不敢跟这样的战友一起上战场。<br />我对你很失望，我一直在想，这么一个优秀的兵，为什么不能把我们当成他的战友。从那天起我开始对你失望，你们是团队的核心、精神、唯一的财富，其它都是虚的，我无法只看你们的表现，我更看重的是人。<br />我终于发现这世界上还有你在意的人，可这并不能说明你就学会了珍惜。</p></blockquote><p>很多时候，觉得世界并非纯粹的黑白，每个人的选择，也不能简单地用对错衡量。<br />第一次收看的时候，我十分讨厌这个家伙：自私、虚伪、圆滑，为了成绩不顾一切。他被淘汰出局时，观众看得很解气。作为对比，许三多单纯、团结、向上，虽然早期经历挫折，但后期军旅之路愈发风顺，这也是观众喜闻乐见的情节。<br />但随年岁增长，我们会发现许三多这样的人几乎不存在，而早期的成才则比比皆是。<br />能从五班重新走回老A，大多数人看到了他超乎寻常的冷静和神乎其神的枪法，却少有人关心他在五班的日子是怎么渡过的。要知道：从山峰跌落，要远比在平地上摔倒疼的多。唯一关心他的只有许三多（有这样的朋友，真是不知道交到什么好运气了）：</p><blockquote><p>你说他逃避了你设计的经历，这个你在意，可他真实经历了什么，你根本就不在意。你设计的几个小时，难道比他过的这段日子还要难吗？你要是去过五班就不会这样。</p></blockquote><p>后来他说自己只是草原上一个跑丢了的兵。草原五班的这段经历弥足珍贵，成才学着知足常乐、学着善待别人，他真的后悔了。<br />浴火重生，他真该感谢袁朗，让他重新起跑，而且跑得不算太晚。<br />最后的演习，很显然，他唯一的机会了。<br />这次没有让袁朗失望：</p><blockquote><p>你像个指挥员开始思考问题了。 吴哲领路，我不在的时候成才领队。</p></blockquote><p>事实上，这就是对成才的肯定。<br />袁朗故意暴露，一是掩护行动，二可能也想培养成才吧。</p><blockquote><p>你的路还很长，比许三多要长的多，同时你的迷茫要比他多得多，如果这是你的路，你愿意来老A吗？</p></blockquote>成才可算成才了~<br /><p align="right">写于2018年8月28日，知乎</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="结构">结构</h2><p>压缩软件的核心在于压缩算法。基于Huffman编码的压缩算法思路：</p><ol type="1"><li>以<strong>二进制方式</strong>读取源文件，按照每8bits作为一个字符；</li><li>统计每个字符的出现频率即为叶子结点的权值，按照Huffman算法得到每个叶子的编码；</li><li>对源文件的每个字符，将新的编码组合为二进制流，按照每8bits一个单位写入压缩文件。</li></ol><p>举例来看：<br />假设我们有待压缩源文件<code>hello</code>，<code>h</code>的ASCII码为<code>01101000</code>，同理可得整个文件的二进制形式<code>0110100001100101011011000110110001101111</code>，共5B，40bits。<br />根据Huffman算法：得到<code>h</code>的编码为<code>00</code>，同理可得整个文件的Huffman编码为<code>0001111110</code>，末尾不够8bits，采用补0的方法可得<code>0001111110000000</code>，按照每8bits一个单位，写入压缩文件的是<code>31</code>和<code>255</code>对应的字符，共2B，16bits。<br />解压缩流程是压缩的逆过程：</p><ol type="1"><li>以<strong>二进制方式</strong>读取压缩文件；</li><li>每次取1bit，从Huffman树的根结点出发，找到某个叶子即为源字符。</li></ol><h2 id="效果">效果</h2><p>做一个简单的比较：</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>压缩软件</th><th>测试文件</th><th>压缩率</th><th>测试文件</th><th>压缩率</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>CompressIt</td><td>txt(840B)</td><td>70.4%</td><td>png(282KB)</td><td>101%</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>WinRaR</td><td>txt(840B)</td><td>14.4%</td><td>png(282KB)</td><td>100%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>压缩率和压缩时间和专业软件没法比。之所以出现压缩文件大于源文件，是因为压缩文件中还存储了Huffman树等信息，为解压所需。<br />对于不同内容的文件，得到的压缩文件大小也不尽相同，这主要与Huffman编码的性质有关。</p><h2 id="理论分析">理论分析</h2><p>Huffman编码依赖于信源的统计特征，其背后的原理在于为出现频率高的字符分配尽可能短的码长，这样就可以降低平均码长：<span class="math display">\[L=\Sigma p_il_i\]</span> 使得<spanclass="math inline">\(L\)</span>最短的编码就是最优编码，可以证明Huffman编码是一种最优编码。<br />同时Huffman编码还是前缀码，简化了解码过程。<br />假设一种理想情况：源文件长<spanclass="math inline">\(len\)</span>很大，共有<spanclass="math inline">\(m\)</span>种不同字符，每个字符用8bits表示，并且每种字符出现频率<spanclass="math inline">\(\frac{len}{m}\)</span>相同，忽略掉存储Huffman树等信息所需的空间。<br />这棵完全二叉树共有结点<spanclass="math inline">\(n=2*m-1\)</span>个，那么树深度为<spanclass="math inline">\(h=1+\lfloor log_2n\rfloor\)</span>，每个字符的压缩长度为<spanclass="math inline">\(h-1=\lfloor log_2n\rfloor\)</span>，故压缩后的串长度为<spanclass="math inline">\(\frac{(h-1)*len}{8}\)</span>，可得压缩率<spanclass="math inline">\(\frac{h-1}{8}\)</span>，即： <spanclass="math display">\[\alpha=\frac{\lfloor log_2(2*m-1)\rfloor}{8}\]</span> 源文件中不同字符种类<spanclass="math inline">\(m\)</span>越小，即源文件分布越集中，压缩效果越好。<br />如果和定长编码比较，可以得到压缩率： <spanclass="math display">\[\alpha=\frac{\lfloor log_2(2*m-1) \rfloor}{\lceillog_2(m) \rceil}\]</span> <spanclass="math inline">\(m\)</span>取值256时，Huffman树是一棵满二叉树，压缩率为100%，并不比8位固定长度编码更高效。</p><h2 id="收获">收获</h2><ul><li><code>EOF</code>和<code>feof()</code><code>EOF</code>是一个定义在<code>cstdio</code>头文件中的宏，一般为-1：</li></ul><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#<span class="meta-keyword">define</span> EOF (-1)</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>但是如果按照二进制读取文件，对于文件中的-1又该如何处理？<br />阮一峰的博客说：</p><blockquote><p>在Linux系统之中，EOF根本不是一个字符，而是当系统读取到文件结尾，所返回的一个信号值（也就是-1）。至于系统怎么知道文件的结尾，资料上说是通过比较文件的长度。</p></blockquote><p>我们通常会写出下面程序来读取文件：</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span

class="line">    <span class="comment">// your code here</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>但是<code>fgetc()</code>在到达文件结尾和发生读取错误的情况下都会返回<code>EOF</code>，所以上述代码不严谨，采用<code>feof()</code>函数来判断文件结尾：</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span

here</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>但是采用<code>feof()</code>也有一个问题：读取最后一个字符后，<code>feof()</code>仍然返回0，进入循环，<code>fgetc()</code>再向后读取一个字符，<code>feof()</code>才返回1，这样程序会多循环一次。<br />所以比较安全的写法是：</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span

/>在压缩过程中，对于不同格式源文件的读取都是采用二进制方式<code>rb</code>。<br />实际上二进制文件和文本文件并没有本质区别，你所看到的内容取决于打开文件的软件对二进制流的解释方式，文件扩展名帮助计算机知道应该用哪种解释方式，通常的文本文件的解释方式有ASCII码和Unicode码。</p>]]></content>

      <title>贝叶斯学习</title>
      <link href="/posts/bayesian-learning/"/>
      <url>/posts/bayesian-learning/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="简介">简介</h2><p>贝叶斯概率理论是由ThomasBayes在1764年提出，采用一种概率的方式进行推理。贝叶斯学习有2个假设： -观察到的样本实例并非确定性事件，而是随机的，服从某种概率分布； -通过对观测数据样本和相关的概率特性进行推理学习能够得到最优的决策或分类。</p><p>贝叶斯学习为衡量多个假设的置信度提供了定量的方法，其依赖于贝叶斯决策理论（BayesianDecisionTheory）。贝叶斯决策理论是一种统计学上的方法，用来定量化地描述使用概率做出的不同决策以及这些决策付出的代价之间的权衡。首先假设一些概率值是已知的，然后根据这些已知概率推理一些未知情况下的概率值，最终利用这些推理的概率值进行决策。</p><p>以分类问题为例，假设有2种鱼分别是鲑鱼和鲈鱼，将w定义为观测到的鱼的类型，令<spanclass="math inline">\(w=w_1\)</span>代表鲈鱼，<spanclass="math inline">\(w=w_2\)</span>代表鲑鱼，定义<spanclass="math inline">\(P(w_1)\)</span>表示下一条鱼是鲈鱼的先验概率，<spanclass="math inline">\(P(w_2)\)</span>表示下一条鱼是鲑鱼的先验概率。先验概率反映了人们根据经验和背景知识对事物的判断，即在看到下一条鱼之前对于<spanclass="math inline">\(P(w_1)\)</span>和<spanclass="math inline">\(P(w_2)\)</span>的判断。如果没有经验上的偏好，就可以设置为均匀先验<spanclass="math inline">\(P(w_1)=P(w_2)\)</span>；如果有诸如海域因素、时间等背景，便可以为<spanclass="math inline">\(P(w_1)\)</span>和<spanclass="math inline">\(P(w_2)\)</span>设置不同的先验概率。另外假设只有这2种鱼，即<spanclass="math inline">\(P(w_1)+P(w_2)=1\)</span>。在仅有先验概率的情况下，选择先验概率大的作为最终决策，这种情况下决策错误的概率为<spanclass="math inline">\(min\{P(w_1),P(w_2)\}\)</span>。</p><p>贝叶斯决策理论是很多重要的学习算法的基础，例如朴素贝叶斯分类器、贝叶斯信念网络以及EM算法等。另外，贝叶斯决策理论为许多非贝叶斯的学习算法提供了很好的数学和框架性理论基础，对某些学习任务而言，贝叶斯学习是最实用的方法之一。</p><p>贝叶斯学习有以下特点： -每个观测到的训练样本都可以很小程度上增大或减小某个假设正确的概率； -先验知识可以和观测数据结合起来决定某个假设的最终概率，可以计算显式的假设概率；- 新实例的预测可以结合多个假设输出概率的加权值； -通常需要一些背景知识或先前经验来确定先验概率，选出贝叶斯最优分类器计算代价比较大。</p><h2 id="贝叶斯定理">贝叶斯定理</h2><p>贝叶斯定理是贝叶斯学习的基石，给定训练数据集D，在假设空间H中寻找最优的假设h，最优假设可以定义为给定数据集D以及H中不同假设的先验概率条件下的最可能的假设。利用贝叶斯定理，在已知假设的先验概率、观测数据以及给定假设下观测到特定数据的概率就可以计算出最有可能的假设。</p><p>给定数据集D以及假设空间H，定义如下记号： -先验概率P(h)：没有训练数据前假设h的初始概率，反映了根据人们的相关认知背景，假设h成为正确假设的概率，如果没有先验知识，可以将每一个候选假设的先验概率设置为相同的。-先验概率P(D)：训练数据D的先验概率，即不知道哪个假设成立的前提下观测到D的概率。- 观测数据的条件概率P(D|h)：在假设h成立的条件下观测到数据集D的概率。 -后验概率P(h|D)：给定观测到的训练数据集D时假设h成立的概率，反映了观测到的训练数据是D时h成立的置信度。</p><p>利用贝叶斯定理可以计算给定训练数据集D下任一假设的后验概率： <spanclass="math display">\[P(h|D)=\frac{P(D|h)P(h)}{P(D)}\]</span></p><p>贝叶斯推理得到的结果很大程度上依赖于先验概率，并且不是完全接受或拒绝假设h，而是给出假设为真的可能性。因此可以计算每个假设的概率，输出其中概率最大的，称为最大后验概率准则（MaximumA Posteriori）。</p><p><span class="math display">\[h_{MAP}=\underset{h\in H}{\operatorname{\argmax}}\ P(h|D) \\=\underset{h\in H}{\operatorname{\argmax}}\ \frac{P(D|h)P(h)}{P(D)} \\=\underset{h\in H}{\operatorname{\argmax}}\ P(D|h)P(h)\]</span></p><p>如果假设空间中每个假设的先验概率都是相同的，即<spanclass="math inline">\(P(h_i)=P(h_j),\forall h_i\in H \wedge \forallh_j\inH\)</span>，那么只需要考虑给定假设h下数据D的似然P(D|h)，这样最大后验概率准则就变为了最大似然估计（MaximumLikelihood）： <span class="math display">\[h_{ML}=\underset{h\in H}{\operatorname{\argmax}}\ P(D|h)\]</span></p><h2 id="最小描述长度原则">最小描述长度原则</h2><p>根据奥卡姆剃刀原则，其它条件相同时选择最简单的假设，最简单的假设可以定义为描述长度最小的假设，即给定假设空间H和数据集D，应该寻找一个假设或者假设组合使得D被最大程度地压缩。定义<spanclass="math inline">\(L_{C}(x)\)</span>表示在编码机制C下编码x需要的最少的比特数为编码机制C下的x的描述长度。<span class="math display">\[h_{MDL}=\underset{h\in H}{\operatorname{\argmin}}\L_{C_1}(h)+L_{C_2}(D|h)\]</span></p><p><spanclass="math inline">\(L_{C_1}(h)\)</span>是假设的描述长度即比特数，反映了模型的复杂程度；<spanclass="math inline">\(L_{C_2}(D|h)\)</span>是当采用假设h编码后数据的描述长度，反映了错误的数目。通常会发现：一个非常复杂的假设（<spanclass="math inline">\(L_{C_1}(h)\)</span>大）会有一个比较好的拟合（<spanclass="math inline">\(L_{C_2}(D|h)\)</span>小），反之一个非常简单的假设（<spanclass="math inline">\(L_{C_1}(h)\)</span>小）会有比较差的拟合（<spanclass="math inline">\(L_{C_2}(D|h)\)</span>大）。因此希望寻找一个假设：既不会过于复杂同时还可以对数据有比较好的拟合。</p><p>如果对MAP的公式进行变形： <span class="math display">\[h_{MAP}=\underset{h\in H}{\operatorname{\argmax}}\ P(D|h)P(h) \\=\underset{h\in H}{\operatorname{\argmax}}\ log_2P(D|h)+log_2P(h) \\=\underset{h\in H}{\operatorname{\argmin}}\ -log_2P(h)-log_2P(D|h) \\\]</span></p><p>可以看到：第一项<spanclass="math inline">\(-log_2P(h)\)</span>对应了最优编码机制<spanclass="math inline">\(C_1\)</span>下h的描述长度<spanclass="math inline">\(L_{C_1}(h)\)</span>，第二项<spanclass="math inline">\(-log_2P(D|h)\)</span>对应了最优编码机制<spanclass="math inline">\(C_2\)</span>下数据的描述长度<spanclass="math inline">\(L_{C_2}(D|h)\)</span>。两者的优化目标是一致的。</p><h2 id="贝叶斯最优分类器">贝叶斯最优分类器</h2><p>通过MAP准则可以求出在给定训练数据下的最有可能的假设，那么如何求出给定训练集下一个新实例的最优预测呢？可以对新实例使用MAP准则，求得最大的假设然后进行分类。</p><p>但是最优的结果应该是结合所有假设的预测结果对新实例进行分类，结合的方法是通过后验概率加权：<span class="math display">\[\underset{v_j\in V}{\operatorname{\argmax}}\ \sum_{h_i\inH}P(v_j|h_i)P(h_i|D)\]</span></p><p>V表示所有可能的预测结果，<spanclass="math inline">\(v_j\)</span>是其中一种预测分类。<spanclass="math inline">\(P(v_j|h_i)\)</span>表示假设<spanclass="math inline">\(h_i\)</span>将新实例预测为<spanclass="math inline">\(v_j\)</span>的概率大小，<spanclass="math inline">\(P(h_i|D)\)</span>表示假设<spanclass="math inline">\(h_i\)</span>的后验概率。</p><p>例如假设空间<spanclass="math inline">\(H=\{h_1,h_2,h_3\}\)</span>，可能的预测结果<spanclass="math inline">\(V=\{+,-\}\)</span>，对于一个新实例假设有： <spanclass="math display">\[P(h_1|D)=0.4, P(-|h_1)=0, P(+|h_1)=1 \\P(h_2|D)=0.3, P(-|h_2)=1, P(+|h_2)=0 \\P(h_3|D)=0.3, P(-|h_3)=1, P(+|h_3)=0 \\\]</span></p><p>那么有： <span class="math display">\[\sum_{h_i\in H}P(+|h_i)P(h_i|D)=0.4 \\\sum_{h_i\in H}P(-|h_i)P(h_i|D)=0.6 \\\]</span> 因此最终选择将新实例分类为-。</p><p>可以看到：贝叶斯最优分类器最大化了新实例被正确分类的概率，在使用相同假设空间和先验知识的条件下，没有其他方法比贝叶斯最优分类器的平均效果好，最终的预测结果可能对应一个不包含于<spanclass="math inline">\(H\)</span>的假设。</p><p>虽然效果很好，但是贝叶斯最优分类器计算代价非常大： -需要遍历假设空间中的所有假设； -当假设空间非常大时这种方式是不可行的。</p><p>因此可以通过吉布斯算法（Gibbs）解决。吉布斯算法根据假设的后验概率分布随机选取一个假设对新实例进行分类。可以证明：在特定条件下，该方法的期望误差最多是贝叶斯最优分类器的两倍。还可以通过采样多个假设并求其预测结果的平均值来提高吉布斯算法的性能，例如可以使用马尔科夫蒙特卡洛采样（MCMC）。</p><h2 id="bagging分类器">Bagging分类器</h2><p>虽然可以使用吉布斯算法来降低计算代价，但是从后验概率分布P(h|D)采样是比较困难的：- P(h|D)的计算本身就比较困难 -对于不是基于概率的分类器例如SVM等P(h|D)是无法计算的 -当假设空间很大时P(h|D)计算结果会很小</p><p>为了解决上述问题，引入Bagging的思想，通过对训练样本的采样实现对后验分布P(h|D)的采样。假设给定的数据集D包含m个样本，自助采样法（Bootstrapsampling）步骤如下： - 从D中有放回地采样m个样本构成数据集<spanclass="math inline">\(D^i\)</span> - D中大约有37%的样本不会被采样到</p><p>Bagging算法步骤如下： - 创建k个自助采样的数据集<spanclass="math inline">\(D^1,D^2,...,D^k\)</span> - 在每个数据集<spanclass="math inline">\(D^i\)</span>独立训练分类器<spanclass="math inline">\(h_i\)</span> -通过相等权重的投票法来对新实例进行分类：</p><p><span class="math display">\[c^*(x)=\underset{c}{\operatorname{\argmax}}\ \sum_{i=1}^{k}P(c|h_i,x)\]</span>由于自助采样法几乎和直接从后验概率分布P(h|D)采样相同，因此Bagging产生的分类器也近似于贝叶斯最优分类器。通常Bagging产生的分类器效果要优于单独的分类器，因为其有效地降低了模型的方差。</p><h2 id="朴素贝叶斯分类器">朴素贝叶斯分类器</h2><p>假设训练集D中的每条实例x均可以被n个属性的组合<spanclass="math inline">\(&lt;a_1,a_2,...,a_n&gt;\)</span>描述，并且<spanclass="math inline">\(v(x)\inV\)</span>是一个有限的集合。那么贝叶斯方法对于新实例的分类是选择一个最有可能的目标值：<span class="math display">\[v_{MAP}=\underset{v_j\in V}{\operatorname{\argmax}}\P(v_j|a_1,a_2,...,a_n)\]</span></p><p>通过贝叶斯定理进行变形： <span class="math display">\[v_{MAP}=\underset{v_j\in V}{\operatorname{\argmax}}\\frac{P(a_1,a_2,...,a_n|v_j)P(v_j)}{P(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)}\]</span></p><p>那么要如何计算<span class="math inline">\(P(v_j)\)</span>和<spanclass="math inline">\(P(a_1,a_2,...,a_n|v_j)\)</span>呢？ - <spanclass="math inline">\(P(v_j)\)</span>可以通过每个目标值<spanclass="math inline">\(v_j\)</span>在训练数据中出现的频率来估算 -在训练数据集很小的情况下，<spanclass="math inline">\(P(a_1,a_2,...,a_n|v_j)\)</span>的估算是不可能的，不同的<spanclass="math inline">\(P(a_1,a_2,...,a_n|v_j)\)</span>的数目等于所有可能的目标值的数量与所有可能的样本数目的乘积。</p><p>为了解决上述问题，提出了朴素贝叶斯假设，即在给定目标值下样本属性之间是条件独立的：<span class="math display">\[P(a_1,a_2,...,a_n|v_j)=\prod_{i}P(a_i|v_j)\]</span></p><p>因此朴素贝叶斯分类器即为： <span class="math display">\[v_{NB}=\underset{v_j\in V}{\operatorname{\argmax}}\P(v_j)\prod_{i}P(a_i|v_j)\]</span></p><p>其中，<spanclass="math inline">\(v_{NB}\)</span>是朴素贝叶斯分类器的预测输出，<spanclass="math inline">\(P(a_i|v_j)\)</span>是训练数据中目标值<spanclass="math inline">\(v_j\)</span>时属性<spanclass="math inline">\(a_i\)</span>的频率。不同的<spanclass="math inline">\(P(a_i|v_j)\)</span>的数目等于不同的目标值数量与属性数量的乘积，该数值远小于不同的<spanclass="math inline">\(P(a_1,a_2,...,a_n|v_j)\)</span>的数目。</p><p>下面举一个朴素贝叶斯分类器的例子，假设训练数据如下： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/286e8b45687d4d259b1ef6ba87433c2f.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /></p><p>需要对于一个新实例{Outlook=sunny, Temperature=cool, Humidity=high,Wind=strong}进行分类，所有可能的目标值是{yes, no}。因此分类器为： <spanclass="math display">\[v_{NB}=\underset{v_j\in \{yes,no\}}{\operatorname{\argmax}}\P(v_j)\prod_{i}P(a_i|v_j)\]</span></p><p>从训练数据可知，<spanclass="math inline">\(P(v_j)\)</span>即不同目标值的概率为： <spanclass="math display">\[P(yes)=9/14=0.64, P(no)=5/14=0.36\]</span></p><p>条件概率<span class="math inline">\(P(a_i|v_j)\)</span>为： <spanclass="math display">\[P(Wind=strong|yes)=3/9=0.33 \\P(Wind=strong|no)=3/5=0.60 \\...\]</span></p><p>因此可以计算： <span class="math display">\[P(yes)P(sunny|yes)P(cool|yes)P(high|yes)P(strong|yes)=0.0053 \\P(no)P(sunny|no)P(cool|no)P(high|no)P(strong|no)=0.0206 \\\]</span></p><p>故最终的预测结果为no。</p><h2 id="贝叶斯信念网络">贝叶斯信念网络</h2><p>贝叶斯最优分类器应用起来代价太大，朴素贝叶斯分类器虽然使用条件独立假设降低了代价，但是很多情况下条件独立假设都难以满足。因此，贝叶斯信念网络做了一个折衷，允许对属性集合的子集应用条件独立假设。</p><p>贝叶斯信念网络是一种概率图模型，通过有向无环图（DAG）来表示一系列变量及它们的条件依赖关系和变量集合的联合概率分布。通常用结点表示变量，可以是观测变量、隐藏变量、未知参数和假设等等；用边表示结点间的依赖关系；条件概率表的每个元素对应图中唯一的结点，存储该结点对于其所有直接前驱结点的联合条件概率。</p><p>贝叶斯信念网络一条非常重要的性质是：每个结点在其直接前驱结点的值给定后，该结点条件独立于其所有非直接前驱结点。条件独立的定义是：在给定Z的条件下X的概率分布与Y的取值无关，即：<span class="math display">\[\forall x_i,y_j,z_k\ P(X=x_i|Y=y_j,Z=z_k)=P(X=x_i|Z=z_k)\]</span></p><p>条件独立的定义可以扩展到多个变量的情形：即在给定变量<spanclass="math inline">\(Z_1,...,Z_n\)</span>的条件下，变量集合<spanclass="math inline">\(X_1,...,X_l\)</span>的概率分布与变量集合<spanclass="math inline">\(Y_1,...,Y_m\)</span>的取值无关： <spanclass="math display">\[P(X_1,...,X_l|Y_1,...,Y_m,Z_1,...,Z_n)=P(X_1,...,X_l|Z_1,...,Z_n)\]</span></p><p>朴素贝叶斯分类器即使用了条件独立假设使得<spanclass="math inline">\(P(X,Y|Z)=P(X|Y,Z)P(Y|Z)=P(X|Z)P(Y|Z)\)</span>。</p><p>贝叶斯网络也可以看作是表示变量之间因果性的因果图，可以进行原因推理或结果预测。例如，假设草坪是湿的记作变量W，那么有多大概率是因为下雨（记作变量R）造成的？那么可以利用贝叶斯网络进行原因推理：<span class="math display">\[P(R|W)=\frac{P(W|R)P(R)}{P(W)}=\frac{P(W|R)P(R)}{P(W|R)P(R)+P(W|\simR)P(\sim R)}\]</span></p><p>同样可以进行结果的预测，假设洒水器打开记作事件S，那么有多大概率草坪是湿的是因为S导致的？即洒水器和下雨都可能导致草坪是湿的：<span class="math display">\[P(W|S)=P(W|R,S)P(R|S)+P(W|\sim R,S)P(\sim R|S) \\=P(W|R,S)P(R)+P(W|\sim R,S)P(\sim R)\]</span></p><p>随着贝叶斯网络的结点与边的增加，可以进行更加复杂的因果推断。</p><h2 id="总结">总结</h2><p>贝叶斯学习为基于先验知识的概率学习方法提供了理论基础，在先验知识的基础上，根据观测数据修正先验知识，计算出每个假设的后验概率进而进行预测。可以选择出在给定观测数据下的最有可能的假设即MAP假设，贝叶斯最优分类器通过后验概率的加权结合了所有可能假设的预测结果去得到新实例的最有可能的预测结果。朴素贝叶斯分类器通过条件独立假设增强了其实用性，在很多实际应用中表现很好。贝叶斯信念网络提供了一种条件独立的变量之间更强大的表示方法，使得其可以有更加广泛的应用场景。</p>]]></content>

/>接下来就可以根据这棵树来计算<code>prefixSums_</code>： 假如要计算<spanclass="math inline">\(0-5\)</span>的和，从下标6出发，一直加到dummynode，得到<code>prefixSums_[6]=9+10=19</code>； 要计算<spanclass="math inline">\(0-9\)</span>的和，从下标10出发，一直加到dummynode，得到<code>prefixSums_[10]=9+19=28</code>。 以计算<spanclass="math inline">\(0-9\)</span>的和为例，结点10存储的是（8，9）的<strong>部分和</strong>，结点8存储的是（0，7）的<strong>部分和</strong>，所以加起来就是<spanclass="math inline">\(0-9\)</span>的和。</p><h2 id="快速实现">快速实现</h2><p>上面求结点的父结点、将下标拆解为二进制去填充树的方式很慢，来看一种稍快的方式。<strong>查询</strong>时，我们需要计算从某结点到dummynode的和，这就涉及计算该结点的parent：假如要求结点7的parent，7的二进制原码为<code>111</code>，-7的补码为<code>001</code>，将原码和补码按位与得<code>001</code>，用原码减去<code>001</code>，得<code>110=6</code>，即7的父结点是6。<strong>更新</strong>时，我们需要更新所有包含该结点的部分和结点：假如更新了结点1，1的二进制原码为<code>001</code>，-1的补码为<code>111</code>，将原码和补码按位与得<code>001</code>，用原码加上<code>001</code>，得<code>010=2</code>，即还要更新结点2，更新了结点2，还要更新结点4......最后来看下非常简洁的实现：</p><figure

It isimportant to know that the sorted side is <strong>at least half of thearray</strong> (longer). So the mid is in this side.</p><p>We can compare nums[mid] with nums[left] (or nums[right]) to decidewhich side is sorted. If <code>nums[mid]&gt;nums[left]</code>, then lefthalf is sorted, else right is sorted.</p><p>The second step is to compare the target with nums[mid] to narrowdown the range.</p><ul><li>Left half is sorted.<br />If target&gt;nums[mid], it must lie in the right interval. So we canmake left pointer forward left = mid + 1.<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210303220721888.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />If target&lt;nums[mid], there exists 2 situations:<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210303214903684.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />The first graph means target is less than mid but bigger than or equalto left, we move the right pointer toward left right = mid.<br />The second graph means target is less than left, thus we move the leftpointer towards right left = mid + 1.</li></ul><p>Finally if nums[mid]==nums[left], it means that left and mid arepointing to the same element due to the distinct values. In this caseright must be mid or mid + 1. Where is the target? It must be on theright side of mid (actually nums[right]) or it do not exist. So we canmove the left pointer by 1 to see nums[right] is equal to target ornot.</p><ul><li>Right half is sorted. You can analysis this by yourself.</li></ul><p>We can write the following code based on the previous discussion:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Solution</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">search</span>(<span class="params">self, nums: <span class="type">List</span>[<span class="built_in">int</span>], target: <span class="built_in">int</span></span>) -&gt; <span class="built_in">int</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">        l, r = <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="built_in">len</span>(nums) - <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">while</span> l &lt;= r:</span><br><span class="line">            m = l + (r - l) // <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">if</span> target == nums[m]:</span><br><span class="line">                <span class="keyword">return</span> m</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">if</span> nums[m] &gt; nums[l]: <span class="comment"># left side is sorted</span></span><br><span class="line">                <span class="keyword">if</span> target &gt; nums[m]:</span><br><span class="line">                    l = m + <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">                <span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">                    <span class="keyword">if</span> target &gt;= nums[l]:</span><br><span class="line">                        r = m - <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">                    <span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">                        l = m + <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">elif</span> nums[m] &lt; nums[l]: <span class="comment"># right side is sorted</span></span><br><span class="line">                <span class="keyword">if</span> target &lt; nums[m]:</span><br><span class="line">                    r = m - <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">                <span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">                    <span class="keyword">if</span> target &lt;= nums[r]:</span><br><span class="line">                        l = m + <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">                    <span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">                        r = m - <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">                l += <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> -<span class="number">1</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="rotated-sorted-array-ii"><ahref="https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/">RotatedSorted Array II</a></h2><p>It is the same as the last one except that the array may contains<strong>duplicates</strong>.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>很久之前观看WJMZBMR特奖答辩时听到了<spanclass="math inline">\(P!=NP\)</span>，一直似懂非懂，看了Matrix67的<ahref="http://www.matrix67.com/blog/archives/105">什么是P问题、NP问题和NPC问题</a>，<del>特意作文纪念</del>。</p><p>一张图就可以解释三者间的关系：<imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190728150856295.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /></p><h2 id="什么是p问题np问题和npc问题">什么是P问题、NP问题和NPC问题</h2><p>这或许是众多OIer最大的误区之一。<br />你会经常看到网上出现“这怎么做，这不是NP问题吗”、“这个只有搜了，这已经被证明是NP问题了”之类的话。你要知道，大多数人此时所说的NP问题其实都是指的NPC问题。他们没有搞清楚NP问题和NPC问题的概念。NP问题并不是那种“只有搜才行”的问题，NPC问题才是。好，行了，基本上这个误解已经被澄清了。下面的内容都是在讲什么是P问题，什么是NP问题，什么是NPC问题，你如果不是很感兴趣就可以不看了。接下来你可以看到，把NP问题当成是NPC问题是一个多大的错误。</p><p>还是先用几句话简单说明一下时间复杂度。时间复杂度并不是表示一个程序解决问题需要花多少时间，而是当问题规模扩大后，程序需要的时间长度增长得有多快。也就是说，对于高速处理数据的计算机来说，处理某一个特定数据的效率不能衡量一个程序的好坏，而应该看当这个数据的规模变大到数百倍后，程序运行时间是否还是一样，或者也跟着慢了数百倍，或者变慢了数万倍。不管数据有多大，程序处理花的时间始终是那么多的，我们就说这个程序很好，具有<spanclass="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span>的时间复杂度，也称常数级复杂度；数据规模变得有多大，花的时间也跟着变得有多长，这个程序的时间复杂度就是<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span>，比如找n个数中的最大值；而像冒泡排序、插入排序等，数据扩大2倍，时间变慢4倍的，属于<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span>的复杂度。还有一些穷举类的算法，所需时间长度成几何阶数上涨，这就是<spanclass="math inline">\(O(a^n)\)</span>的指数级复杂度，甚至<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n!)\)</span>的阶乘级复杂度。不会存在<spanclass="math inline">\(O(2*n^2)\)</span>的复杂度，因为前面的那个“2”是系数，根本不会影响到整个程序的时间增长。同样地，<spanclass="math inline">\(O (n^3+n^2)\)</span>的复杂度也就是<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n^3)\)</span>的复杂度。因此，我们会说，一个<spanclass="math inline">\(O(0.01*n^3)\)</span>的程序的效率比<spanclass="math inline">\(O(100*n^2)\)</span>的效率低，尽管在n很小的时候，前者优于后者，但后者时间随数据规模增长得慢，最终<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n^3)\)</span>的复杂度将远远超过<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span>。我们也说，<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n^{100})\)</span>的复杂度小于<spanclass="math inline">\(O(1.01^n)\)</span>的复杂度。</p><p>容易看出，前面的几类复杂度被分为两种级别，其中后者的复杂度无论如何都远远大于前者：一种是<spanclass="math inline">\(O(1),O(log(n)),O(n^a)\)</span>等，我们把它叫做多项式级的复杂度，因为它的规模n出现在底数的位置；另一种是<spanclass="math inline">\(O(a^n)\)</span>和<spanclass="math inline">\(O(n!)\)</span>型复杂度，它是非多项式级的，其复杂度计算机往往不能承受。当我们在解决一个问题时，我们选择的算法通常都需要是多项式级的复杂度，非多项式级的复杂度需要的时间太多，往往会超时，除非是数据规模非常小。</p><p>自然地，人们会想到一个问题：会不会所有的问题都可以找到复杂度为多项式级的算法呢？很遗憾，答案是否定的。有些问题甚至根本不可能找到一个正确的算法来，这称之为“不可解问题”(UndecidableDecision Problem)。The HaltingProblem就是一个著名的不可解问题，在我的Blog上有过专门的介绍和证明。再比如，输出从1到n这n个数的全排列。不管你用什么方法，你的复杂度都是阶乘级，因为你总得用阶乘级的时间打印出结果来。有人说，这样的“问题”不是一个“正规”的问题，正规的问题是让程序解决一个问题，输出一个“YES”或“NO”（这被称为判定性问题），或者一个什么什么的最优值（这被称为最优化问题）。那么，根据这个定义，我也能举出一个不大可能会有多项式级算法的问题来：Hamilton回路。问题是这样的：给你一个图，问你能否找到一条经过每个顶点一次且恰好一次（不遗漏也不重复）最后又走回来的路（满足这个条件的路径叫做Hamilton回路）。这个问题现在还没有找到多项式级的算法。事实上，这个问题就是我们后面要说的NPC问题。</p><p>下面引入P类问题的概念：如果一个问题可以找到一个能在多项式的时间里解决它的算法，那么这个问题就属于P问题。P是英文单词多项式的第一个字母。哪些问题是P类问题呢？通常NOI和NOIP不会出不属于P类问题的题目。我们常见到的一些信息奥赛的题目都是P问题。道理很简单，一个用穷举换来的非多项式级时间的超时程序不会涵盖任何有价值的算法。</p><p>接下来引入NP问题的概念。这个就有点难理解了，或者说容易理解错误。在这里强调（回到我竭力想澄清的误区上），NP问题不是非P类问题。NP问题是指可以在多项式的时间里验证一个解的问题。NP问题的另一个定义是，可以在多项式的时间里猜出一个解的问题。比方说，我RP很好，在程序中需要枚举时，我可以一猜一个准。现在某人拿到了一个求最短路径的问题，问从起点到终点是否有一条小于100个单位长度的路线。它根据数据画好了图，但怎么也算不出来，于是来问我：你看怎么选条路走得最少？我说，我RP很好，肯定能随便给你指条很短的路出来。然后我就胡乱画了几条线，说就这条吧。那人按我指的这条把权值加起来一看，嘿，神了，路径长度98，比100小。于是答案出来了，存在比100小的路径。别人会问他这题怎么做出来的，他就可以说，因为我找到了一个比100小的解。在这个题中，找一个解很困难，但验证一个解很容易。验证一个解只需要O(n)的时间复杂度，也就是说我可以花O(n)的时间把我猜的路径的长度加出来。那么，只要我RP好，猜得准，我一定能在多项式的时间里解决这个问题。我猜到的方案总是最优的，不满足题意的方案也不会来骗我去选它。这就是NP问题。当然有不是NP问题的问题，即你猜到了解但是没用，因为你不能在多项式的时间里去验证它。下面我要举的例子是一个经典的例子，它指出了一个目前还没有办法在多项式的时间里验证一个解的问题。很显然，前面所说的Hamilton回路是NP问题，因为验证一条路是否恰好经过了每一个顶点非常容易。但我要把问题换成这样：试问一个图中是否不存在Hamilton回路。这样问题就没法在多项式的时间里进行验证了，因为除非你试过所有的路，否则你不敢断定它“没有Hamilton回路”。</p><p>之所以要定义NP问题，是因为通常只有NP问题才可能找到多项式的算法。我们不会指望一个连多项式地验证一个解都不行的问题存在一个解决它的多项式级的算法。相信读者很快明白，信息学中的号称最困难的问题——“NP问题”，实际上是在探讨NP问题与P类问题的关系。</p><p>很显然，所有的P类问题都是NP问题。也就是说，能多项式地解决一个问题，必然能多项式地验证一个问题的解——既然正解都出来了，验证任意给定的解也只需要比较一下就可以了。关键是，人们想知道，是否所有的NP问题都是P类问题。我们可以再用集合的观点来说明。如果把所有P类问题归为一个集合P中，把所有NP问题划进另一个集合NP中，那么，显然有P属于NP。现在，所有对NP问题的研究都集中在一个问题上，即究竟是否有P=NP？通常所谓的“NP问题”，其实就一句话：证明或推翻P=NP。</p><p>NP问题一直都是信息学的巅峰。巅峰，意即很引人注目但难以解决。在信息学研究中，这是一个耗费了很多时间和精力也没有解决的终极问题，好比物理学中的大统一和数学中的歌德巴赫猜想等。</p><p>目前为止这个问题还“啃不动”。但是，一个总的趋势、一个大方向是有的。人们普遍认为，P=NP不成立，也就是说，多数人相信，存在至少一个不可能有多项式级复杂度的算法的NP问题。人们如此坚信P≠NP是有原因的，就是在研究NP问题的过程中找出了一类非常特殊的NP问题叫做NP-完全问题，也即所谓的NPC问题。C是英文单词“完全”的第一个字母。正是NPC问题的存在，使人们相信P≠NP。下文将花大量篇幅介绍NPC问题，你从中可以体会到NPC问题使P=NP变得多么不可思议。</p><p>为了说明NPC问题，我们先引入一个概念——约化(Reducibility，有的资料上叫“归约”)。</p><p>简单地说，一个问题A可以约化为问题B的含义即是，可以用问题B的解法解决问题A，或者说，问题A可以“变成”问题B。《算法导论》上举了这么一个例子。比如说，现在有两个问题：求解一个一元一次方程和求解一个一元二次方程。那么我们说，前者可以约化为后者，意即知道如何解一个一元二次方程那么一定能解出一元一次方程。我们可以写出两个程序分别对应两个问题，那么我们能找到一个“规则”，按照这个规则把解一元一次方程程序的输入数据变一下，用在解一元二次方程的程序上，两个程序总能得到一样的结果。这个规则即是：两个方程的对应项系数不变，一元二次方程的二次项系数为0。按照这个规则把前一个问题转换成后一个问题，两个问题就等价了。同样地，我们可以说，Hamilton回路可以约化为TSP问题(TravellingSalesmanProblem，旅行商问题)：在Hamilton回路问题中，两点相连即这两点距离为0，两点不直接相连则令其距离为1，于是问题转化为在TSP问题中，是否存在一条长为0的路径。Hamilton回路存在当且仅当TSP问题中存在长为0的回路。</p><p>“问题A可约化为问题B”有一个重要的直观意义：B的时间复杂度高于或者等于A的时间复杂度。也就是说，问题A不比问题B难。这很容易理解。既然问题A能用问题B来解决，倘若B的时间复杂度比A的时间复杂度还低了，那A的算法就可以改进为B的算法，两者的时间复杂度还是相同。正如解一元二次方程比解一元一次方程难，因为解决前者的方法可以用来解决后者。</p><p>很显然，约化具有一项重要的性质：约化具有传递性。如果问题A可约化为问题B，问题B可约化为问题C，则问题A一定可约化为问题C。这个道理非常简单，就不必阐述了。</p><p>现在再来说一下约化的标准概念就不难理解了：如果能找到这样一个变化法则，对任意一个程序A的输入，都能按这个法则变换成程序B的输入，使两程序的输出相同，那么我们说，问题A可约化为问题B。</p><p>当然，我们所说的“可约化”是指的可“多项式地”约化(Polynomial-timeReducible)，即变换输入的方法是能在多项式的时间里完成的。约化的过程只有用多项式的时间完成才有意义。</p><p>好了，从约化的定义中我们看到，一个问题约化为另一个问题，时间复杂度增加了，问题的应用范围也增大了。通过对某些问题的不断约化，我们能够不断寻找复杂度更高，但应用范围更广的算法来代替复杂度虽然低，但只能用于很小的一类问题的算法。再回想前面讲的P和NP问题，联想起约化的传递性，自然地，我们会想问，如果不断地约化上去，不断找到能“通吃”若干小NP问题的一个稍复杂的大NP问题，那么最后是否有可能找到一个时间复杂度最高，并且能“通吃”所有的NP问题的这样一个超级NP问题？答案居然是肯定的。也就是说，存在这样一个NP问题，所有的NP问题都可以约化成它。换句话说，只要解决了这个问题，那么所有的NP问题都解决了。这种问题的存在难以置信，并且更加不可思议的是，这种问题不只一个，它有很多个，它是一类问题。这一类问题就是传说中的NPC问题，也就是NP-完全问题。NPC问题的出现使整个NP问题的研究得到了飞跃式的发展。我们有理由相信，NPC问题是最复杂的问题。再次回到全文开头，我们可以看到，人们想表达一个问题不存在多项式的高效算法时应该说它“属于NPC问题”。此时，我的目的终于达到了，我已经把NP问题和NPC问题区别开了。到此为止，本文已经写了近5000字了，我佩服你还能看到这里来，同时也佩服一下自己能写到这里来。</p><p>NPC问题的定义非常简单。同时满足下面两个条件的问题就是NPC问题。首先，它得是一个NP问题；然后，所有的NP问题都可以约化到它。证明一个问题是NPC问题也很简单。先证明它至少是一个NP问题，再证明其中一个已知的NPC问题能约化到它（由约化的传递性，则NPC问题定义的第二条也得以满足；至于第一个NPC问题是怎么来的，下文将介绍），这样就可以说它是NPC问题了。</p><p>既然所有的NP问题都能约化成NPC问题，那么只要任意一个NPC问题找到了一个多项式的算法，那么所有的NP问题都能用这个算法解决了，NP也就等于P了。因此，给NPC找一个多项式算法太不可思议了。因此，前文才说，“正是NPC问题的存在，使人们相信P≠NP”。我们可以就此直观地理解，NPC问题目前没有多项式的有效算法，只能用指数级甚至阶乘级复杂度的搜索。</p><p>顺便讲一下NP-Hard问题。NP-Hard问题是这样一种问题，它满足NPC问题定义的第二条但不一定要满足第一条（就是说，NP-Hard问题要比NPC问题的范围广）。NP-Hard问题同样难以找到多项式的算法，但它不列入我们的研究范围，因为它不一定是NP问题。即使NPC问题发现了多项式级的算法，NP-Hard问题有可能仍然无法得到多项式级的算法。事实上，由于NP-Hard放宽了限定条件，它将有可能比所有的NPC问题的时间复杂度更高从而更难以解决。</p><p>不要以为NPC问题是一纸空谈。NPC问题是存在的。确实有这么一个非常具体的问题属于NPC问题。下文即将介绍它。</p><p>下文即将介绍逻辑电路问题。这是第一个NPC问题。其它的NPC问题都是由这个问题约化而来的。因此，逻辑电路问题是NPC类问题的“鼻祖”。</p><p>逻辑电路问题是指的这样一个问题：给定一个逻辑电路，问是否存在一种输入使输出为True。<br />什么叫做逻辑电路呢？一个逻辑电路由若干个输入，一个输出，若干“逻辑门”和密密麻麻的线组成。看下面一例，不需要解释你马上就明白了。<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190728155740104.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />这是个较简单的逻辑电路，当输入1、输入2、输入3分别为True、True、False或False、True、False时，输出为True。</p><p>有输出无论如何都不可能为True的逻辑电路吗？有。下面就是一个简单的例子。<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190728155803196.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />上面这个逻辑电路中，无论输入是什么，输出都是False。我们就说，这个逻辑电路不存在使输出为True的一组输入。</p><p>回到上文，给定一个逻辑电路，问是否存在一种输入使输出为True，这即逻辑电路问题。</p><p>逻辑电路问题属于NPC问题。这是有严格证明的。它显然属于NP问题，并且可以直接证明所有的NP问题都可以约化到它（不要以为NP问题有无穷多个将给证明造成不可逾越的困难）。证明过程相当复杂，其大概意思是说任意一个NP问题的输入和输出都可以转换成逻辑电路的输入和输出（想想计算机内部也不过是一些0和1的运算），因此对于一个NP问题来说，问题转化为了求出满足结果为True的一个输入（即一个可行解）。</p><p>有了第一个NPC问题后，一大堆NPC问题就出现了，因为再证明一个新的NPC问题只需要将一个已知的NPC问题约化到它就行了。后来，Hamilton回路成了NPC问题，TSP问题也成了NPC问题。现在被证明是NPC问题的有很多，任何一个找到了多项式算法的话所有的NP问题都可以完美解决了。因此说，正是因为NPC问题的存在，P=NP变得难以置信。P=NP问题还有许多有趣的东西，有待大家自己进一步的挖掘。攀登这个信息学的巅峰是我们这一代的终极目标。现在我们需要做的，至少是不要把概念弄混淆了。</p>]]></content>

/><p>说明：上篇《老实人的归国与失身》获得了超过预想的关注，文中虽声明“本故事纯属虚构”，但实际上真实情况与艺术加工大约各占一半。上篇文章想要表达的主题可能并不十分清楚，不同人看到的东西会有极大不同。因此在今天这篇文章中我将详细讲一下这些年来发生的事情以及自己的一些思考，本文句句事实，不说一句大话、假话、空话，不贩卖焦虑，不灌任何鸡汤和毒鸡汤。我也不讳言自己身上出现的问题，曾经的生活充满不堪，有些遮蔽在眼前的玻璃滤镜总要有需要被打破的一天。</p><p>时至今日，我也是时候与过去的自己告别，开始新的第二人生了。我也希望将自己的经历写出来，给境遇相似的人提供一些可能的思考或警示。几年折腾下来，不敢说积累了多少人生经验，但是讲教训我这里是有很多的，这篇文章的目的也在于用亲身经历指出我自己及处境相似的年轻人思维和行动上的误区。其中的一些个人想法可能不完善或者不成熟，也欢迎批评指教。</p><hr

id="section-1">1</h2><p>好了废话不多说，开始讲故事，十年经历，尽在此篇。如果觉得故事过长，请直接看最后的结论。</p><p>美西时间2018年6月6日下午，我上完了学生时代的最后一节课程，只待最后的考试、毕业、回国、入职。打开朋友圈，看到大家都在怀念当年的高考，作为一个上了大学后就基本没再怎么提起高考这茬事的人，突然觉得这个事情好遥远。不过从尘埃落定以来我也一直想找个机会分享一下我个人几年来遇到的事情，就索性在高考七年之后学生时代临近结束的时候，进行一次彻底的总结，向过去的自己说再见，轻装迎接未知的未来。这篇的主题其实和高考本身没有多大关系，不过还是像上篇一样，从高中时代讲起。</p><p>如同《老实人的归国与失身》当中讲到的那样，我十年之前升入一个高考大省省会的重点高中，虽然管理并非变态到监狱式的程度，但是由于升学压力的缘故，大部分学生的日子还是过得相对波澜不惊。在一个在郊区住校，一两周回一趟家，手机都不一定人手一部，诺基亚N95就能称霸，上QQ空间可能是最好的娱乐活动的时代，我们的日常生活也不像十年之后的今天有着各种各样的诱惑。如同我现在看到快手抖音和知乎上的00后们接受着我们从没想过的信息，做着我们想追求却曾经不敢去做的事情，18岁的他们姿势水平可能完爆25岁的自己，就觉得时代的发展如同车轮一般，而90后已经成了被冲在沙滩上的前浪。</p><p>而在那样的环境下，可想而知，学生当中最受欢迎的群体并不是只知道好好学习的书呆子（虽然我自己可能并不是），而永远都是绯闻缠身的帅哥靓女们，家里有一些背景考到一本线就能上本地985的关系户，手机一周一换的富二代，carry大家打游戏的大咖，带着些许叛逆的所谓不良少年，甚至高中时代成熟的早偷尝禁果还顺便能给朋友们性启蒙的人。虽然当我之后见到更大的世界之后发现这都不算什么，但放在当时，这些现象还是对很多十五六岁经历一片空白的少男少女有着一定杀伤力的。</p><p>在这些人面前，我竟有些自卑，说不清楚自己除了成绩稍微好一些之外还有什么优点，更何况成绩根本没好到可以完爆他们的程度。而我个人的课余生活就更是单调，<strong>上晚自习看《萌芽》追连载小说得到的快乐，可能并不亚于几年之后在国际期刊发表一作文章的快乐</strong>。人在成长过程中都是这样，小时候得到个玩具就能高兴好几天，可是长大之后很有可能金钱和权力等这些世俗成功标准的降临都带不来一样的感动了。人的阈值总是随时间而增长的，这是好事还是坏事呢？</p><p>我在这所高中成绩比较稳定位于年级中上，课余和寒暑假的时间都用来搞竞赛，虽然略吃力但也有所收获。正常情况下单凭高考考到中等985学校没问题，如果竞赛保送可以去前十学校。我自己高中时候的目标是上清华北大，但由于从当时的情况看来过于不切实际，因此也很少跟别人提起。到了高三，竞赛获了省一拿到了保送资格，报了清华和另外一所华五学校，清华没考过线，另外一所学校过了录取线却把我调剂到了法医专业。由于实在是不想读这个专业，不得不放弃保送资格强行拼高考。高三一年各次模拟考试我的成绩稳定在六百三四十（虽然事后看来，模拟题和高考真题完全不是一个路数），即便加上竞赛加分，离梦想的学校也相距太远。以至于到了高三的五月，我竟觉得“就这样吧，考到哪算哪”。</p><p>于是高考前最后的一个月我连作业都懒得做了，每天用几乎全部的时间研究历年高考真题，琢磨里面的规律。2011年高考的三天也波澜不惊的过去了，甚至高考之后答案都懒得去对，抱着出了分之后随便报个志愿的弃疗态度就去睡了十五天大觉。结果出乎意料的是超常发挥了近三十分，莫名其妙的考到了全市前五全省前五十，竟然可以真的报清北了。</p><p>鉴于当时的确不知道自己喜欢什么和适合什么专业，当天急急忙忙的就和清华签了约，而专业也是招生老师推荐给我的，我想都没想就接受了，身边的长辈也全都给我说：</p><p><strong>“你都上了清华了，学什么专业不重要”。</strong></p><p>那个时候自己对未来的想法只有：<strong>“我想做一个科学家”</strong></p><p>（然而可能连什么是科学家都不甚清楚），看到是个理工科专业，就糊里糊涂接受了。这就是一个典型的战术上勤奋战略上懒惰的例子。</p><p>我本人并非小县城出身，与“学霸”这个词更是八竿子打不着。但是，可能时至今日我自己身上仍然还有一些小县城学霸思维方式的残余。尤其在高考大省，我们很多人在18岁之前除了学习什么都不懂，而工人阶级或者知识分子的父母从小告诉我们的就是“<strong>读书改变命运</strong>”甚至是“<strong>考个好大学什么都不用愁了</strong>”。</p><p>固然在他们那个时代可能是这样，但是如今，这样的“<strong>努力就能得到回报</strong>”、“<strong>一分耕耘一分收获</strong>”的单线程的、线性的思维方式在更大程度上是对生活的一种不完全归纳甚至是片面归纳。从小地方考入最高学府，必须承认眼界和见识必然比不过一部分同龄人：2017年夏天我在斯坦福带过一个国内初中生组成的所谓“游学团”，平均年龄十三四岁，平均去过十几二十个国家，有的甚至是来美国开独奏会的，聊天当中处处被教做人，甚至有白比他们年龄长一倍的感觉，这样的眼界和见识怎么比？</p><p>事实上，比无头苍蝇乱撞般瞎努力更重要的是选择，比选择更重要的是信息，还有历史行程、社会形势、贵人相助以及运气等因素。<strong>有时候必须承认人与人的差距可能努力程度占三分，而其他因素，占七分，甚至九十七分</strong>。也因此，小县城学霸以及我这样的伪“小县城学霸”到了顶尖名校之后不可避免会有一定失落感，这也是现实存在的一个问题。</p><h2 id="section-2">2</h2><p>从这一刻起，没有金刚钻却强行揽了瓷器活的日子开始了。德不配位，必会撞墙。不过话说回来，如果没有当年的撞墙也不会有如今的成长。下面所有的故事，可以称为“<strong>一个名校（主流价值观中的）差生的试错与教训</strong>”。整个过程，也就是跟自己的局限、幼稚与无知斗争的过程。</p><p>虽然从考上清华那一刻开始自己就隐隐约约感觉到，高考一次的成功不能说明太多问题，更没有一劳永逸的感觉，然而现实永远比想象的更加要命。大一第一学期我和高三的辛苦程度差不多，但是期中考试的成绩竟然是（大约）年级倒数前三（年级100人左右），有一门差点没及格。看到成绩的时候我突然懂得了很多事情，而大学四年的目标，也由在本领域做出点成绩变成了安全毕业。</p><p>我当时的想法就是，既然学术（单说成绩方面）这条路走不通，那索性就去多试试别的。于是我从那之后几乎每学期都选35-40学分的课，想拓展自己的视野，找找自己可能能行的方面究竟在哪里。同时加了学生会，加了社团，认识了一些从当时看来闪闪发光的牛人，甚至还有过做了个互联网信息平台差点创业的经历。故事发展到这里，从外界看来似乎我的大学生活将要过得风生水起，然而似乎并没这么简单。</p><p>到了大二，我逐渐认识到自己对本专业并没有像自己想象的那般兴趣，而且学习也越来越吃力。带着困惑，我去咨询了一些前辈，前辈给的建议都是“好好学专业课，好好做科研，当你用到你所学的知识的时候你自然会喜欢的”（这是我唯一能得到的信息，尽管帮助着实有限）。于是我进了实验室（这在当时已经算起了个大早），然而发现根本不知道自己学的知识能够如何用到科研当中。此时此刻，同年级里有的同学已经开始接独立课题，有的同学已经有文章发表（非一作，不过放到现在，大二发一作的也已经不计其数了）。我在想，成绩拼不过不要紧，科研别输给他们。</p><p>终于在大三的时候，换过好几个实验室，我在一个交叉学科方向找到了自己的兴趣，而且这个方向一做就是四年。至于成绩，好的时候年级倒数1/3，差的时候年级倒数1/6，已经不在乎了。凭这样的成绩直接申国外博士几乎是不可能的，保研本系或者本校也差一点，于是不得不通过读硕士找个跳板，试图积累成绩以外的其他资源。其实在这个阶段，我也想过未来发展的其他可能性，但苦于真的不知道该去哪寻找信息（甚至那个时候大部分出国党都不知道有暑期研修这东西存在，反观今日，没个海外研修都不好意思出国），周围以我的眼界所能听到的声音也是“万般皆下品，唯有科研高”这样的价值观占主导，所以我并不觉得这里面有什么问题，或者并不知道自己选择这条路有多少是出于自己真心所想，而又有多少是出于随大流或者生活的惯性。</p><p>于是我算是在两眼一抹黑的情况下申请出国，匆匆忙忙准备申请材料，运气还算好，也拿到了较为不错的录取，还提前联系好了将来想跟的导师和实验室。再加上大四一年拼命科研，虽然到最后成绩仍然在倒数1/4，但国内国际期刊均有论文收获，这对于大学四年没得过任何荣誉（如果课余参加的一些数学物理方面的竞赛不算的话，只算官方荣誉）没拿过任何奖学金甚至很少受到赏识的自己来说也觉得没白来一遭。四年来受到的自信心打击太多，甚至到了最后已经被碾压到心如止水了，也越来越觉得有些时候人与人的差距不是通过努力能够追上的。即便如此，最后也涉险毕业，准备去美国开始一段新的人生，虽然直到本科毕业，我连一次出国经历也都没有。</p><h2 id="section-3">3</h2><p>在另一段“没有金刚钻却强行揽了瓷器活”的经历开始之前，我觉得这里有必要评价一下<strong>名校学渣</strong>这种客观存在且无数人经历过或正在经历的状态。</p><p>曾经知乎上有个问题，叫“在清华大学当学渣是种怎样的体验？”，回答者甚众，甚至在我本科时代的周围，包括我自己在内，都有很多人实实在在的经历过这样的挫折。很多时候当我们分享起自己被碾压的经历，会换来别人的不理解，甚至是“何不食肉糜”。然而这里面的痛苦却是真实的，我也见过有人因为学习成绩跟不上，退学的有之，休学的有之，抑郁的有之，甚至自杀的都存在。<strong>在很多情况下成绩成了衡量一个人唯一或者最重要的标准，赢者通吃，而在这一评价体系下没有胜出的人就很难得到主流舆论体系的承认。</strong></p><p>本科毕业之后我曾经跟一些这种处境的学弟学妹聊过，看到他们的迷茫我似乎也看到了当年自己的影子。那种自卑、焦虑、挫折、不被承认的感觉是的的确确困扰着我们当中很多人的，更何况名校学生对自己的期待和现实很难不产生心理落差。</p><p>由于人与人的痛苦是不共通的，每个人的解决方案也不尽相同。放在我身上，当我被学习成绩打击的时候，我当时的选择是在学生会做好事情，去实验室做好科研，而身边一些人可能是通过外出实习、体育运动、恋爱等方式排解。当被主流评价体系打击到怀疑自己存在的价值和意义时，我现在能给出的建议是，<strong>出去申请实习（甚至完全不必是自己对口行业的实习）</strong>，真正接触一下工作是怎样的，破除单一价值观带来的禁锢（不管这种单一价值观是外界强加的还是自己想象的），你会发现原来自己还能做出这样的贡献。我们在学校里的跑道只有一条，但实际上现实生活中的跑道有无数条。树挪死人挪活，换个环境很多时候都会带来不错的发挥。</p><p>现在，我想提出这样一个问题：<strong>如果读者作为名校毕业生，在大学四年过去之后，享受了较好的教育资源，你认为在什么方面自己应该具有一定优势</strong>？文章的最后我将谈一下自己对这个问题的看法。</p><h2 id="section-4">4</h2><p>2015年夏天，我仍然是在两眼一抹黑的情况下来到了美国。清华四年的经历虽然洗刷掉了我所有的骄傲和大部分的自信心，让我明白自己其实实力也就是中人之资，但还是模模糊糊抱着一个想当科学家的梦想。可是此时，我面临的主要矛盾已经变成了看到了更大的世界和自己内心可怜的信息量和姿势水平之间的矛盾。</p><p>本科期间我对象牙塔里的这一些规则或者体系有了一定的了解，但对社会的认知其实比刚入大学的时候并没有多少长进。在国内的时候，本身和其他背景的人交流就不多，科研压力也让我每天都在闷头向前赶，却很少抬起头来想想为什么，或者看看周围更广阔的风景。结果就是，到了美国，当不得不睁眼看世界的时候，发现身边的人一个比一个生活多姿多彩光鲜亮丽，而自己就像一个只知道埋头干活反而连活都干不好的傻B。</p><p>诸位别笑，这的确是我来到美国的第一感觉。一个见识有限的人突然到了一个大环境当中，不可避免有一种刘姥姥进了大观园的感觉。很多人的经历也让我大开眼界，有好的也有坏的，好的让我觉得“我大学期间都错过了什么”，而不好的让我觉得“原来还有这样的人存在，服气服气”。也因此，来到美国一两个月，我的三观就几乎被刷新了一遍。</p><p>在科研领域遇到的挫折（实际上什么都没做出来）让我发现这条路并非这么容易，生活中遇到过不靠谱的人和事太多我也只能说自己曾经太傻太天真。经历了刚出国换环境的阵痛，我再次陷入了不知道将来想做什么的困惑当中。但是所不同的是，这一次，我知道的信息更多，有一定可以选择的余地，也做好了试错的准备。</p><p>但是主业也容不得耽误，于是匆匆忙忙填完了博士申请，结果在关键时刻一篇投往顶级期刊的一作文章被拒，唯一可以拿得出手的砝码丢了，拿到的是隔壁学校降转硕士的录取（按照当时的情况留本校可能可以拿到博士，但在当时的环境下过得实在是太不开心，加之所在的研究方向不喜欢，不想一直这样下去）。</p><p>虽然不甘心但是也没办法，实力不济加上运气不好，只能接受现实，第一时间联系好了自己想做的方向的导师，因为正常情况下做得好是能留下来读博的。同时我利用这当中的空闲时间，投过咨询机构的实习，尝试了他们的思维方式。之后又投了几家金融业的实习，虽然做的也并不愉快。我试图通过这个，去弥补本科期间，甚至更早的时候，对这个社会，对各个将来可能从事的行业认知的缺失。然而事实告诉我，你还是太年轻，想的太简单。</p><p>说到这里，我想谈一下我们很多年轻人对这个社会认知的问题。我们在真正独立走上社会之前，接受的宣传是通过主流价值观为主的。但即使这样，这样的信息也难免偏颇，很多时候我们只看到了事物的A面，而没有看到B面，甚至可能还有S面。就单说科研领域，社会告诉我们的是做出成果无尽荣光，可是却不会告诉我们一将功成万骨枯，以及很多领域象牙塔和工业界存在脱节。金融领域我们看到从业者西装革履光鲜亮丽，但是背后却有朝八晚三不为人知的辛酸。创业圈更是这样，有人ICO，IPO一夜暴富，可更多的却是亏完了钱打水漂睡沙发的窘迫。</p><p>打个比方，我所在的城市高楼林立科技发达，然而当夜幕降临在一些不为人知的角落，也存在流浪者、大麻甚至是枪击。很多时候我们带着有色的，甚至可能是带着粉红泡泡的眼镜去看待社会，这个滤镜是我们了解社会的为数不多的途径，即便它存在失真。因此初出茅庐的人很容易去带着单纯的心态去相信A面是社会的全貌，然而当撞到南墙的时候，可能会遭到这样的批评：“<strong>你对社会的认知存在偏差，这锅你不背谁背</strong>？”你总觉得哪里不对，却无法反驳。</p><p>确实我们在往上攀登和向广阔的未知天地进发的时候，每一步都在离开自己的舒适区，这也就意味着我们在小圆内对世界的认知是没法向外延拓的。每一步都存在风险，每一步都在跳未知的坑，再加上人生不如意十之八九，难免怀疑人生，其实到最后不管是焦虑还是佛系，都是挣扎之后的结果。打碎面前的云山雾罩似乎很容易，但是人总愿意去相信事物对自己有利的一面，而潜意识的厌恶可能存在的风险。到了这里，闭关自守也罢，虚无主义也罢，随着这样的恶性循环慢慢成了我们挥之不去的绊脚石。也因此，很多时候虽然道理就在那里摆着，但唯有撞南墙尝苦果，才能让我们冲破这层人性原罪的束缚，去认知更大的更全面的新世界。</p><h2 id="section-5">5</h2><p>如果说刚刚出国的时候的情况是两眼一抹黑，那么一年之后的状态就是面前摆着几条道路，每条似乎都通向光明的前途，你却根本不知道该选哪一条。所幸导师对我很好，不管是在学术方面还是在生活方面都给了我很多人生经验和指引，让我有一种发自内心的因为受到知遇之恩所以必须要好好干活的感觉。受到这样的激励，我也立志在科研领域做出自己的一份贡献，然而由于接触的世界越来越大，我开始听到了很多不同的声音，而这些声音是我从来没有想象过的。</p><p>就比如说2016年很火的两篇帖子<ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/50766928">《T大本科舍友阶级分化实录，该何去何从？》</a>与<ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/44186681">《凭什么我辛苦二十年，现在却比别人差那么多？》</a>。从局外人的角度看来，我们可以说里面的主人公书生气过重，博士快要毕业了仍然没有认清楚一个事实，即你的学习成绩和学术成果和你将来在世俗评价标准下的成功只有很弱的相关性。可是话说回来，这样的谴责虽然道理正确，但并无助于解决问题，而且难免有一种站着说话不腰疼的感觉。更重要的是，久居象牙塔中的我们（包括我在内，也曾具有上述的思维误区），<strong>跟社会的接触少了，就很容易用这种单一的线性的价值观去评判自己和他人，尤其是和别人一比较，各种不如意便会纷至沓来</strong>。而且还是那个问题，人总愿意去相信对自己有利的观点，这就很容易用战术上的勤奋去掩盖战略上的懒惰（即便我在很长时间的科研当中也是如此，没仔细想why就去想how并亲身实践了无数种错误的how，结果自然是充满了无用功和南辕北辙）。</p><p>从上面这个现象引申出来另一个现象，即对部分存在产学研脱节现象学科的劝退，想必大家都了解了许多。如今信息比以前通畅得多，大学新生选择专业以及高校毕业生选择行业的时候比几年之前更懂得去参考历史的行程决定个人的发展方向，其实也未尝不是个好事。我个人曾经也是一个劝退者，但是如今，我觉得更应该做的是，消除信息不对称，也就是让了解信息有限的人们不仅认识到学术这条路的A面，更要了解其B面，对将来可能面临的风险有一个充分的估计，想明白自己追求的是什么。<strong>经过深思熟虑之后做出的选择，要比冲着高大上的标签或者七大姑八大姨的期待做出的选择，要更加理性</strong>。在这个方面，我自己就是活生生的目标不明确东一榔头西一棒子乱打的反例。</p><p>不得不承认做科研的经历是有一定痛苦的（其实任何事情都这样，不存在既高大上又光鲜亮丽的事情）。在自己的课题研究过程中，无数次遇到解不出来的公式，跑不出来的程序，和理论不一样的实验结果，以及各式各样用尽世间已有知识解释不了的问题。与此同时，周围的很多人在积极谋求转行，而金融和互联网成为了转行的首选。在这样的气氛中，除非是自己心里有明确目标且能塌下心来坐得住的人，否则包括我在内的很多人也难免被舆论影响，盖因心里虽然有目标但目标根本不坚定。此时此刻，我再次陷入迷茫，经常思考两个问题：1.我为什么要来这里？2. 我将来到底想做什么？</p><h2 id="section-6">6</h2><p>时间到了2017年，在社会经历着指数型的科技发展浪潮的过程当中，一种名为勃学的新思潮发展的如火如荼。简而言之，勃学基于失败学，我们每个人都有自己的失败，我们要对自身的失败有清醒的认识。从外界看来，取得了一定世俗成就的人本应是成功的，这样的失败是不是何不食肉糜呢？但是确实，这种思潮确实反映了一部分通过自我奋斗达到一定高度，所看到的世界却灰暗了许多的人们的认同感，尤其是名校毕业生和中产人士。为什么明明已经得到了很多，它们却带来了无尽的挫败感呢？</p><p>这里不谈阶级固化、精英主义等高大上的话题，只想举一个例子。我们的祖辈可能一生都没有走出过小镇，日出而作日落而息生活简单而充实。我们每个人都有那种小学初中同学，早早离开学校进入社会，在我本人朋友圈里看到的一些例子是，他们没有离开家乡，在家乡做着一些相对低收入低技术含量的工作，例如摆摊开店，大部分已经结婚生子，看起来十分快乐，现世安稳岁月静好。而我们很多人，从高考的残酷竞争中杀出来进入名校，可能还出国见了更大的世界，或是找到了高收入的工作，可为什么得不到他们的那种快乐呢？</p><p>我们或许可以这样思考，古人提出过人生三境界，如果我们永远不走出自己的舒适区，那么就是“<strong>看山是山看水是水</strong>”，或者说“我未入过繁华之境，未听过喧嚣的声音，未见过太多生灵，未有过滚烫心情，所以也未觉大洋正中有多么安静”。也因此，对客观世界的认知符合自己的常识，可以很轻易的通过自己的常识得到快乐。</p><p>然而到了第二境界，“<strong>看山不是山看水不是水</strong>”，当我们见了更大的世界，发现自己的一套体系已经不足以解释自己看到的世界，就比如苦心孤诣探索学术十几年，主观上做出了足够的努力，却在客观上收获不了自己想要的“书中自有黄金屋，书中自有颜如玉”，认知崩塌陷入对自己的怀疑，不管归因于“错的是我”抑或是“错的是世界”，价值观就会解体重塑。无论是打破幻影还是打破枷锁，这个过程都是十分痛苦的。</p><p>然而大部分人终其一生也很难达到第三境界，“<strong>看山还是山看水还是水</strong>”，没有一定经历和成就，这一层是连想都很难想象到的。即便是”众里寻他千百度；蓦然回首，那人却在灯火阑珊处“的”啊，原来你也在这里“，不经历一番”昨夜西风凋碧树，独上高楼，望尽天涯路“和”衣带渐宽终不悔，为伊消得人憔悴“的苦痛挣扎也是无法实现的。由于我自己远远没有达到这一境界，因此不多赘述。但总之，”你所认为的世界运行的规律“和”世界真实的运行规律“两者之间大部分情况下存在夹角，甚至有时候夹角还是钝角。因此，你不得不不断地调整自己对世界的认知，而这里面的阻力和惯性，以及调整之后与之前状态的错位，就容易让人怀疑自己所想所做到底对不对。</p><p>曾经有两篇阅读量极高的文章，<ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/52031149">《我上了985211才发现自己一无所有》</a>和<ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/65098412">《一个月就辞职，一个北大女生的求职悲欢》</a>。虽然和勃学并未有联系，但反映的问题却是共通的。有些人对这种现象的批评，包括”无病呻吟“也罢，”庸俗矫情“也罢，其实仔细想想是站不住脚的，由于痛苦不共通，这就像问抑郁症的人为啥要自杀一样缺乏同理心，更何况我相信每个人都有过这样的怀疑和纠结，只是程度不同而已。人生对每个人都只有一次，进入社会见到更大的世界，必然面临着自我和世界的冲突，而处在冲突当中的个人，很容易将自己遇到的问题放大，陷入痛苦，就像小时候辛苦搭好的积木倒塌之后仿佛失去了全世界一样。从这个意义上来说，我倒是觉得同为年轻人的自己和这里面提到的主人公有一定共鸣。同是天涯沦落人，相逢何必曾相识？不过话说回来，该类文章其实反映了一个问题，就是“<strong>学区房值钱（个人奋斗几十年都不一定买得起）</strong>”和“<strong>学历不值钱（名校毕业生的世俗成就达不到内心期望）</strong>”之间的矛盾。所以，这个错位背后，是哪里错了呢？（这个问题我也没有想明白）。</p><h2 id="section-7">7</h2><p>人生总有想不明白的哲学问题，就像科研也永远不能一路顺风一样。2017年发生过太多的事情，以至于刚脱胎换骨一遍的三观又被现实撕得粉碎。其间遇到了转博被拒的挫折，认识了硅谷科技界上百的IT工作者，回国看到了祖国翻天覆地的变化，也经历了对自己价值的彻底怀疑，人际关系的全面崩溃，甚至无数次夜不能寐在凌晨四点的帕罗奥图的天空下失声痛哭。</p><p>然而，冥冥之中总有个声音对我说：</p><p>“<strong>你得到今天的这一切，本来就是运气眷顾，你还想要什么呢</strong>？”</p><p>对啊，能走到今天，我所拥有的东西本来就不是和自己的能力匹配的，你是不是太贪得无厌了？</p><p><strong>“将寄托于花朵的思念用言语来表达出来，我丝毫不想伤害这个世界，如果没有聆听者的话，你就可以放任自己为所欲为吗？</strong></p><p><strong>然而，然而，你却把打算摘给别人的花留下，然后看到他的时候，却为了能得到赞扬把花送给他。</strong></p><p><strong>能找到这么漂亮的花，我是个好孩子吧。我来告诉你怎样去摘这朵花吧！</strong></p><p><strong>像这样假装亲切，好好炫耀一番。以花为借口亲近他，伪君子。”</strong></p><p

id="section-8">8</h2><p>2018年3月，我来到洛杉矶参加了一场学术会议，算是亲手给自己的追寻（本专业的）学术成就之路画下一个句号。讲完自己海报的一刻，突然有一种神清气爽的感觉，来不及放下东西，直奔加州理工去拜访几个多年未见的好朋友。此时此刻，我终于彻底想明白了一个道理，“<strong>科研和世俗成功两者之间即便不是垂直，夹角也至少有88°</strong>”。有人问88°是怎么得来的，我说用量角器量出来的。量出这个角度，我花了三年，而另一些人，甚至是十三年，三十年。饭桌上跟几个博士在读的朋友聊过，发现原来他们这等神人也有世俗的烦恼（虽然这是废话，但我的思维始终没有转过这个弯来）。家家有本难念的经，我们都是普通人，为什么要互相比较一些有的没的来给自己增加不必要的烦恼呢？求仁得仁，想要什么，就冲着那个方向放手一搏吧。</p><p>于是在几个月的刷题和几年来积累的计算机方面的知识、能力和项目经历的基础上，3月下旬的某一天我一夜之间通过各路朋友的内推向国内互联网公司投了五十份简历。虽然自己这几年来学术上不敢说有所收获，但是人脉和软实力上所积累的一切是我至今不悔留美三年的一个很重要的原因。虽然自己的知识体系必然不系统，但是我个人觉得自己的水平和科班CS大三大四的水平还是比较相当的（除了没有相关科研及实习经历以外）。闻道有先后，术业有专攻，如是而已，终究亡羊补牢也没晚多少。由于名校牌子的加成，整个求职过程还算顺利，连轴面试将近一个月，国内最后拿到4个offer，美国这边也投了几个小公司并都走到了最后一面，由于国内的offer到了，加之我个人在这里实在是过得不快乐，所以就没再继续面下去。本着此心安处是吾乡的原则，选完城市，再选公司，兜兜转转回到了最熟悉的五道口，加入一家蒸蒸日上的创业公司。（题外话：在五道口的前辈和友人们欢迎到时找我约饭。）</p><p>由于我实力有限加上并非走的正常校招流程，具体的求职细节就不在这里讲了，以防班门弄斧。如果同为转专业且对这个过程有兴趣将来可以私聊。当然不得不承认，由于求职始于匆忙，中间各种问题也出过不少，还出过一个差点没法毕业的乌龙，不过最终的结果还算不错，经过了几年的尝试，用了无数次排除法，在此刻虽然我也不敢说自己一定喜欢做什么，但是有把握说自己不喜欢做什么。这就像一个深度优先搜索一样，撞了南墙再回头，虽然有时候走了不少冤枉路撞了不少南墙，比别人晚到了目的地，可是看到的东西也更多了。</p><p>我曾经想过，如果高中多搞一门竞赛会怎样，大学选择一个不同的专业会怎样，研究生期间年年暑假出去实习会怎样，再仔细一想，在没有信息的情况下有多少人能做出这样的选择，而从最终结果看起来也不过是小的得失而已。有些事情放在当时看，重要吗？的确重要。可是从更长远的时间看来，什么都不是。如同幼儿园丢了个小红花，中学错过了喜欢的人，高考失利，求职遇挫，每个人都会对此做出应激反应，可是几年之后回首，也不过是饭桌上的一件谈资而已。</p><p>在上篇《老实人的归国与失身》中我曾经提到，求职过程中受到高中同学的内推，文中提到的高中同学本科位于家乡普通一本，通过考研来到了北京，积累了无数的实习经历最终在另一家独角兽企业独当一面。文中结尾提到的“明明是我先来的，为什么会变成这样呢？”本来是一个出自《白色相簿2》的梗，招致了一些不懂背景的人的误会。什么叫做线性思维/学生思维？这就是。早起的人不一定能赶上集，生活本来也没有先来后到。更何况别人在另一些方面比自己先来，比如工业界经验，比如对社会的认知，这都是象牙塔本身所给不了自己的。该篇文章中的主人公可能也是幸存者偏差的产物。</p><p>前段时间和朋友讨论，说到了不同的人在不同阶段所做的努力和承受的痛苦。从高考大省杀出来固然需要拼命，但从考研大省逆袭何尝不需要努力，而且艰苦程度也是非亲历者不能想象。我们能看到的例子是通过个人奋斗逆袭走上人生巅峰的人们，可是在这背后的B面，多少人在这一过程中折戟撞墙，最终成为了默默无闻的普通人，他们的故事又如何去表达出来呢？</p><p>什么是幸存者偏差？2018年高考全国二卷的作文就很能说明问题。</p><p><img src="20191202223556152.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" />2018年6月，在即将离开美国的时候，我与科研大佬聊过他们申请教职当中的悲与喜，与硅谷科技从业者谈到科技下一步的发展方向，与现在的牛人本科生讨论他们的梦想，与00后一代学习他们的价值体系和处世方式，也与在国内的本科同学们交流不同行业的求职经历，以及当前日新月异的一线城市。曾经的自己只顾脚下的一条路，以为这就是整个世界，到头来路越走越窄以至于痛撞南墙。而抬起头来，发现参差多态乃是幸福本源，生活的跑道比自己想象的还要多得多。而这个时代恰恰也是信息量爆炸的时代，每个人都在追寻自己的梦想，就看谁能把握住这里面的机会。</p><p><strong>“回想起历往云烟终于让我全都看透</strong></p><p><strong>闭着眼低头走过那份温柔”</strong></p><p align="right">——《涙の理由》 栗林美奈实</p><p>总之，运气眷顾，在一个新的领域，我在不知道自己有没有金刚钻的情况下又接下了瓷器活。可如今最大的不同就是，即便没有金刚钻，我也知道如何去获得它。即便无法获得，我也知道如何打磨现有的资源使之无限接近真正的金刚钻。几年的摸索告诉了我这样的方法论，也算是不虚此行了。感谢一路上遇到的前辈和同辈，感谢他们给我的指引和人生经验，感谢遇到的挫折使我想明白自己内心深处究竟想要的是什么，感谢命运待我还算不薄。路还很长，所以更要心无旁骛望着远方。</p><p>最后放一张图，描述在这么多年来我”想当一名科学家“的这个愿望的强烈程度是如何变化的。虽然走到现在，这条路上的追寻暂时鸣金收兵了，但失之东隅收之桑榆，我也看到了更广阔的风景，开始了另一条路上新的追寻。</p><figure><img src="20191202223756684.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">在这里插入图片描述</figcaption></figure><h2 id="section-9">9</h2><p>时光飞逝，我自己的学生时代即将结束。清华四年经历告诉了我自己的能力是有局限的，而美国三年经历告诉了我天有多高地有多厚。虽然初心只是自己幼稚时候的一厢情愿，但人在长大的过程中都会变的，甚至在半年之前我都没有料到今天是这样的结局，计划永远赶不上变化，而未知的未来可能信息量更大。有时候我在思考一个问题：我一路以来享受了最好的教育资源，可是有没有做出相符的成绩和贡献呢？如果没有的话，我从中积累了什么优势呢？眼界，人脉，还是对更大的世界的认知，对自己较为全面的评价？</p><p>如果限制我们的成就的是外在因素，很多时候我们只会惋惜命运待人不公。就如同如果基础教育能够普及，广袤的非洲能走出多少科学家？可是这里面无数的聪明人就因为食不果腹而终其一生无法为人类的发展做出贡献。而我自己，出身明明优于90%的同辈人，享受着最好的教育资源，不缺天时地利人和，想要找到贵人相助也不难，在人生的重要选择关口也不乏运气垂青，理应有着更大的使命，为这个世界做出自己更大的贡献。然而，有时候事情的发展偏离了预想的轨道，现实情况和自我期待出现错位，明明自己能力达不到却不得不去努力争取，明明追寻的东西就在眼前看似唾手可得但就是得不到，那种失落和不甘心，如同差一点爬到高峰又狠狠摔下，带来的痛苦就要比在平地上跌倒要强烈得多。</p><p>我的经历和反思讲完了，在最后，我觉得有必要给出一些简单的结论：</p><p><strong>（0）选择正确的方向比努力更重要，而信息的通畅是做出明智选择的保证。将获取信息的能力从1提到2，边际效应要远远胜过努力程度由9提到10。</strong></p><p><strong>（1）对于名校同学，有时候我们自身带着一种骄傲，但在校内评价体系下受到的打击会令我们自卑，两者叠加在一起会让我们很难对自己有准确的定位。然而，既然享受着资源优势，而且终究都要走出象牙塔走向社会（即便是立志从事科研工作也不能免除与更大的世界打交道），不如早点接触真实的工作环境，在找到自己价值所在的同时，提前排除错误选项或者选定正确选项，不至于到最后赢在了成绩却输在了社会经验。</strong></p><p><strong>（2）对于非名校同学，高考、毕业学校这些东西和将来的成绩的相关度是很弱的，通过主动获取信息做出明智的选择，避免无头苍蝇一般的无效努力，进而比名校学生优秀的也大有人在。没有那种小心翼翼瞻前顾后患得患失，反而更大胆去试错和总结经验，这些都不是从书本上能够学到的。</strong></p><p><strong>（e）(e=2.718281828)综上所述，高考考的如何和去什么学校读书真的没那么重要，在需要努力的时候尽力而为，但永远记得仅仅是努力本身是没有价值的。打怪升级获得的奖励，从来都不是和打怪的难度成正比。</strong></p><p><strong>（3）老实人们会习惯性认为，努力读书、努力工作等等才是能力，然而，真相却是，“不老实”可能是一种比个人奋斗更重要的能力。</strong></p><p><strong>（π）(π=3.141592654)因此，老实，其实并不是一个好事。</strong></p><p>满纸荒唐言，一把辛酸泪。</p>]]></content>

<imgsrc="https://imgconvert.csdnimg.cn/aHR0cHM6Ly9pbWcyMDE4LmNuYmxvZ3MuY29tL2Jsb2cvMTI2MDU4MS8yMDE5MDkvMTI2MDU4MS0yMDE5MDkxNTIzMTQyMDE5MS0xMTMxOTk2Nzc2LnBuZw?x-oss-process=image/format,png" /><br />其中序遍历序列为<spanclass="math inline">\(2413\)</span>，可以在VS中用单步调试的方法跟踪相应的变量：<br />当<code>root==NULL(root指向2的左孩子)</code>时，此时的系统栈（将1和2都压栈，因为中序遍历需要先访问左孩子）：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190916223229149.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />这时<code>if</code>不成立，执行83行的<code>return</code>语句，接着退栈，回到78行，此时的<code>root指向2(因为此时程序已经来到了新的栈顶)，并且向这个新栈顶返回了一个空的seq</code>：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190916223847870.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />接着执行79行(因为这是上一个函数<code>return</code>的，所以不会再一次执行78行)，将2存入<code>seq</code>中；<br />执行80行（<code>root</code>指向4），进而执行78行，<code>root</code>指向4的左孩子，此时的系统栈（很明显可以看到从<strong>栈底到栈顶依次存放根结点到当前<code>root</code>结点的路径</strong>上的结点）：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190916225924483.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />同样，执行<code>return</code>语句，退栈，将<code>seq</code>(里面只有2)返回到这一层，这一层的<code>root</code>指向4，接着将4存入<code>seq</code>；<br />到80行，调用<code>inOrder()</code>使得<code>root</code>指向4的右孩子，右孩子为空，所以返回并退栈，<code>root</code>重新指向4，此时80行执行完毕，整个<code>if</code>执行完毕，返回<code>seq</code>并退栈，<code>root</code>返回到了2，以2为根结点的子树中序遍历完毕，系统栈：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190916230804141.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />继续执行，return到78行，<code>root</code>指向1，将1存入seq，以此类推，就可以得到整个的遍历序列。</p><p>最关键的是：之所以要递归调用<code>inOrder</code>，就是因为现在还不想访问当前的结点（对于中序，要先找到最左边的结点），所以通过递归的方式将当前暂时不想访问的结点压入系统栈，找到了想访问的结点后，访问它并利用退栈操作返回父结点。<br

      <title>球员归化</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="历史时刻">历史时刻？</h2><p>2019年9月10日，2022年卡塔尔世界杯亚洲区预选赛，马尔代夫对阵中国。归化球员Elkeson身披11号球衣，代表中国男足首发出战。不久之前，Elkeson加入中国国籍，甚至连自己中文名字（艾克森）还不会写、国歌都不会唱，却成为了国家队的一员。</p><h2 id="福还是祸">福还是祸？</h2><p>我个人一直是坚定地反对无血缘归化，可是舆论好像支持的比较多。回顾历史，国足只在2002年打进过一次世界杯。受到零几年黑球、假球的影响，我们的足球人才出现了严重的断档，自然国家队的水平也长期徘徊在亚洲二三流。长期无缘世界杯让我们的球迷焦躁不安，更是由于老大喜欢足球，并且多次在公开场合表示要把中国足球搞上去，中国足协出了各种各样的奇葩政策：</p><ol type="1"><li>高薪聘请国外教练：里皮、阿里汉、卡马乔，解约卡马乔时支付5000万违约金；</li><li>在中超联赛施行U23政策，俱乐部也是上有政策、下有对策：U23球员的出场时间非常可怜，只是满足足协最低要求而已；</li></ol><p>可惜，就是不把主要精力放在青训上，总想着捷径：当然，这也是官僚一贯的急功近利作风，前人栽树后人乘凉的事想都不要想。中超联赛踢得如火如荼，可是没有跑道的专业球场屈指可数；外援垄断了射手榜和关键位置，国内球员只是陪跑；如果静下心来踏踏实实做好青训，规范我们的联赛，开展俱乐部各级梯队的比赛，做好校园足球的普及和推广，就像姚明对中国篮球的改革一样，那么我们10年后一定可以打进世界杯，可惜领导从来不会有这样的耐心。其实我们的目标只是打进世界杯而已，从来就不是提高中国足球的水平。围绕这个任务，所有的一切也都得到了非常合理的解释：在恒大建立国家集训队、无血缘归化......有人说归化可以带动中国足球水平的提高，让越来越多的孩子走上职业联赛，并且归化和青训可以同时进行。。。就足协那个尿性，一旦从归化中尝到了甜头，还有谁愿意冒着风险、付出成本去做青训？我对Elkeson并不反感，从2013年亚冠就开始看他的比赛。在俱乐部层面，他给中国足球带来了亚冠冠军；平时生活中对中国文化也很尊重；加入中国国籍可能有对于这个国家的热爱，但是背后是8~9位数的薪资以及复杂的利益纠缠，否则怎么会那么轻易主动放弃自己祖国国籍？Elkeson只是第一个，后面可能还有高拉特、费尔南多、阿洛伊西奥......这就是恒大许老板所谓的“全华班”？这样即使打进世界杯，看着巴西人组成的前锋线，球迷心里真的还会有那份民族自豪感吗？另外，归化对于联赛的公平运作也是毁灭性的打击。其他俱乐部的外援都去恒大，足协钦定的政策谁敢不从？喊了这么多年联赛职业化，可惜中超的职业化只是政治因素下的可笑的玩物！曾经，国家队的每场比赛我都不会错过：赢了我激动地欢呼，输了我会难过好几天。见过它的高光，也陪伴它走过低谷。这次我是真的失望到无法接受：从今天开始，我不会再关注中国足球的任何消息，这潭泛着恶臭的死水已经开始恶心到我了！以后就看看梅西、阿森纳和西班牙就行了~</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="村上在耶路撒冷">村上在耶路撒冷</h2><p>2009年春天，村上春树获得了“耶路撒冷文学奖”。当时巴勒斯坦和以色列之间的冲突愈演愈烈，很多人都劝阻村上不要去以色列领奖，何况村上其实对公开场合发表演讲、接受采访这些事是比较排斥的。他最终还是决定出席（原因他在演讲时解释了），并且发表了极为精彩的演说--“高墙与鸡蛋”。全文还是不太好找，不过最终在林少华先生的博客中找到了中文版（林少华先生是村上小说很重要的翻译家）：<ahref="http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_48f36ce00100e3qd.html">原文链接</a></p><blockquote><p>我作为一个小说家，换句话说，作为以巧妙说谎为职业的人来到这里、来到耶路撒冷市。</p><p>当然，说谎的不都是小说家。诸位知道，政治家屡屡说谎，外交官和军人说谎，二手车推销员、肉铺和建筑业者也说谎。但小说家说谎和他们说谎的不同之处在于：小说家说谎不受道义上的谴责。莫如说谎说得越大越高明，小说家越能得到人们的赞赏和好评。为什么呢？</p><p>这是因为，小说家能够通过巧妙说谎、通过栩栩如生的虚构而将真相拽到另一场所投以另一光照。以其固有的形式捕捉真相并予以准确描述在许多情况下是不可能的。惟其如此，我们才要把真相引诱出来移去虚构地带，通过将其置换为虚构形式来抓住真相的尾巴。但为此必须首先在自己心底明确真相的所在，这是巧妙说谎所需要的重要资格。</p><p>可是今天我不准备说谎，打算尽可能说实话。一年之中我也有几天不说谎，今天恰好是其中的一天。</p><p>实话实说好了。关于此次来以色列接受耶路撒冷文学奖，不少人劝我最好拒绝。甚至警告说如果前来，将开展不买我的书的运动。无须说，理由在于加沙地区的激战。迄今为止，已不止一千人在被封锁的城区丧生，据联合国报告，大多数是儿童、老人等手无寸铁的平民。</p><p>接到获奖通知以来，我本人也一再自问：这种时候来以色列接受文学奖果真是妥当的行为吗？不会给人以支持作为纷争当事者一方、拥有占绝对优势的军事力量并积极行使的国家及其方针的印象吗？那当然不是我所希望的。我不认可任何战争，不支持任何国家。同时，自不待言，我的书在书店被人拒买也不是我所希求的。</p><p>然而，经过深思熟虑，我重新坚定了来这里的决心。原因之一，就在于有那么多人劝我最好别来。或许我有一种大部分小说家都有的“犟脾气”--别人叫我“别去那里”、“别干那个”、尤其那样警告我的时候，我就偏偏想去或想干，此乃小说家的nature（天性）。为什么呢？因为小说家属于这样一种人：无论刮怎样的逆风，也只能相信自己实际目睹、自己实际手摸的东西。</p><p>正因如此，我才出现在这里。较之不来，选择了来；较之什么也不看，选择了看点儿什么；较之什么也不说，选择了向诸位说点儿什么。</p><p>有一句话（message）请允许我说出来，一句个人性质的话。这句话在我写小说时总在我脑袋里挥之不去。它并非写在纸上贴在墙壁，而是刻于我的脑壁。那是这样一句话：</p><p><strong>假如这里有坚固的高墙和撞墙破碎的鸡蛋，我总是站在鸡蛋一边。</strong></p><p>是的，无论高墙多么正确和鸡蛋多么错误，我也还是站在鸡蛋一边。正确不正确是由别人决定的，或是由时间和历史决定的。假如小说家站在高墙一边写作--不管出于何种理由--那个作家又有多大价值呢？</p><p>那么，这一隐喻到底意味什么呢？在某种情况下它是简单明了的。轰炸机、坦克、火箭、白燐弹、机关枪是坚硬的高墙。被其摧毁、烧毁、击穿的非武装平民是鸡蛋。这是这一隐喻的一个含义。</p><p>但不仅仅是这个，还有更深的含义。请这样设想好了：我们每一个人都或多或少分别是一个鸡蛋，是具有无可替代的灵魂和包拢它的脆弱外壳的鸡蛋。我是，你们也是。再假如我们或多或少面对之于每一个人的坚硬的高墙。高墙有个名称，叫作体制（System）。体制本应是保护我们的，而它有时候却自行其是地杀害我们和让我们杀人：<strong>冷酷</strong>地、高效地、而且系统性地（Systematically）。</p><p>我写小说的理由，归根结底只有一个，那就是为了让个人灵魂的尊严浮现出来，将光线投在上面。经常投以光线，敲响警钟，以免我们的灵魂被体制纠缠和贬损。这正是故事的职责，对此我深信不疑。不断试图通过写生与死的故事、写爱的故事来让人哭泣、让人惧怕、让人欢笑，以此证明每个灵魂的无可替代性--这就是小说家的工作。我们为此而日复一日地认真编造故事。</p><p>我的父亲去年夏天去世了，活了九十岁。他是个退休教师，也是个兼职佛教僧侣。在研究生院就读期间被征召入伍，参加了中国大陆的战斗。我小的时候，他每天早上都在饭前向佛坛献上长长的深深的祈祷。一次我问父亲为什么祈祷，他回答为了在战场死去的人，为了在那里--无论友方敌方--失去性命的人。每次看见父亲祈祷的身姿，我都觉得那里似乎漂浮着死亡的阴影。</p><p>父亲去世了，其记忆--还没等我搞清是怎样的记忆--也彻底消失了。但是，那里漂浮的死亡气息仍留在我的记忆中。那是我从父亲身上继承的少数然而宝贵的事项之一。</p><p>我在这里想向诸位传达的只有一点：我们都是超越国籍、种族和宗教的一个一个的人，都是面对体制这堵高墙的一个一个的蛋。看上去我们毫无获胜的希望。墙是那么高那么硬，那么冰冷。假如我们有类似获胜希望那样的东西，那只能来自我们相信自己和他人的灵魂的无可替代性并将其温煦聚拢在一起。</p><p>请这样想想看。我们每一个人都有可以拿在手中的活的灵魂，体制则没有。不能让体制利用我们，不能让体制自行其是。不是体制创造了我们，而是我们创造了体制。</p><p>我想对诸位说的仅此一点。</p><p>荣获耶路撒冷奖，我很感谢。感谢世界很多地方都有看我书的人。我要向耶路撒冷的每一位读者致以谢意。毕竟是因了你们的力量我才出现在这里的。但愿我们能够共同拥有什么--非常有意义的什么。我很高兴得以来此向诸位讲话。</p></blockquote><p>村上的小说一直强调个人的自由，他也一直希望每个个体都能拥有独特的生活方式、活出自我，而不是被体制化（Institutionalization）。其实发表演讲时，如果不是因为战争的背景以及村上的解释，那么我对于<strong>永远站在鸡蛋一边</strong>是无法苟同的：试想如果鸡蛋（弱势者）的行为的确非常过分，那么如此绝对地站队是不是有些混淆是非呢？不过村上的浅层隐喻是在讽刺战争对平民的伤害，更深层次的是对体制的搏斗以及自由的向往，这些观点足以让我信服。</p><h2 id="hard-boiled">Hard-Boiled</h2><p>这篇演说比较有趣的地方在于：村上这个系统建构狂魔为读者解释了他的一本小说的名字（这个我也是从杨照老师那里了解的）：《世界末日与冷酷仙境》。这本小说本来是直接用英语命名，把英语写成日语外来语起名。原来叫做Hard-BoiledWonderland and the End of the World，Wonderland比较明显出自于Alice'sAdventures inWonderland（爱丽丝梦游仙境），但是Hard-Boiled只看字面意思的话，很难理解为什么会翻译成冷酷，应该是沸腾加热这种意思才对啊~Hard-Boiled一般就只用在美国人吃早餐时候：服务员会问你要的eggs是要soft-boiledor hard-boiled？全熟的蛋也不能叫做冷酷吧？美国在上世纪有一类流行小说叫做Hard-Boiled DetectiveStory，村上一直受西方文学影响，而且很喜欢这种类型的小说。所谓硬汉侦探小说，其实并不是大家想象中的那种超级英雄：无坚不摧、拯救世界。这种Hard-Boiled“硬汉”其实只是看起来很酷，戴个墨镜，实际上只是在逞强而已，他们是在社会上摸爬滚打多年、不断受挫，内心很柔弱、很受伤的一群人，成为侦探是因为他们和罪犯有着相似的生活经历，所以了解他们。这种类型的硬汉虽然不会轻易认输，但是其实也是在苦苦支撑而已，就像是早餐店里那种Hard-Boiledeggs，以为自己成熟了，但是如果这种蛋碰到墙上，那么破碎的必然是蛋，而高墙不会有任何损失。即使这样，村上也还是会<strong>永远站在鸡蛋一边，无论高墙多么正确和鸡蛋多么错误。</strong></p>]]></content>

      <title>翻唱与抄袭</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="缘由">缘由</h2><p>曾经，《老男孩》风靡一时，无数人热泪盈眶，我也感动得一塌糊涂。筷子兄弟也凭借此歌迅速走红，获得无数粉丝青睐。我起初对日本音乐了解甚少，平时也不太接触。偶然听到山口百惠、中森明菜等一些昭和时代歌姬的演唱之后，才逐渐开始欣赏日本音乐。毫不夸张地说，日本音乐在亚洲绝对顶级水准。这也造就了一大批靠翻唱、抄袭日本曲目成名的歌手，以及一些我们曾经为之泪流满面的歌曲。当然，拿到原创的允许进行翻唱无可厚非，但是没有版权、重新填词并公开商演又是一种怎样的行为呢？</p><h2 id="ありがとう">ありがとう</h2><p>大桥卓弥的《ありがとう》（谢谢），就是《老男孩》的原曲。 <ahref="https://b23.tv/av22011510">原曲</a>关于亲情的MV非常感人。</p><p>筷子兄弟在没有授权的情况下填词发布，后来面临起诉时才购买版权。这种“先上车后补票”的行为并不少见，据说《父亲》的旋律是把福山雅治的《milktea》副歌部分和宫本笑里的《stay withme》副歌部分拼凑到一起的，不过并没有实锤。有人戏谑（ありがとう网易云热评）：“在知道老男孩是翻唱的之后，我一点也不好奇为什么筷子兄弟的曲风一下从老男孩变成了小苹果”。</p><h2 id="反思">反思</h2><p>很多网友戏称：中岛美雪养活了大半个华语音乐圈。很不幸，国内许多歌手的代表作都是翻唱美雪阿姨的：任贤齐的《伤心太平洋》、王菲的《容易受伤的女人》......刘若英的《后来》是翻唱Kiroro的《未来へ》，《很爱很爱你》也是翻唱这个组合的同一张专辑......再看最近，自称“原创歌手”的花粥代表作《盗将行》、《出山》都涉嫌抄袭； <ahref="https://b23.tv/av45107069">《出山》原曲</a> 附上<ahref="https://b23.tv/av45298740">左右声道对比</a></p><p>神曲《起风了》也是翻唱高桥优的《ヤキモチ》（吃醋），附上<ahref="https://b23.tv/av23618612/p1">MV链接</a>真的太多太多了，我曾经在贴吧看过一个统计，国内知名歌手翻唱日本歌手的歌曲一共列了好几十个页面......说这些不是为了引战，我们要正视差距，填词都很不错，优秀的作曲真的太少太少，所以周杰伦才那么难能可贵。反观日本，几乎每个歌手都是创作者，作品的旋律也非常优美，能把人深深吸引进故事里，而不是写一些口水歌。唱功再好，最多就是个singer，成为不了musician~</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="前言">前言</h2><p>《挪威的森林》是村上春树很有名的一部小说，但我想大多数人阅读的时候都只是把书名当作一个符号，而不是作为故事去追究。我国台湾知名文学评论家杨照先生说过：村上的书里有太多太多典故，如果你只是把这些典故当作符号看待，那么会少很多阅读的乐趣。你探寻这些典故越深，就越能体会村上想要表达的意思。那么《挪威的森林》是怎么来的？</p><h2 id="the-beatles">the Beatles</h2><p>了解村上的人都知道：他生命中最重要的几件事就是写作、听音乐、长跑和翻译。Norwegian Wood(This Bird HasFlown)是Beatles在1965年发行的歌，这首歌的歌词非常简单：</p><blockquote><p>I once had a girl Or should I say she once had me She showed me herroom Isn't good Norwegian wood?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She asked me to stay And she told me to sit anywhere So I lookedaround And I noticed there wasn't a chair I sat on a rug biding mytime</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Drinking her wine We talked until two and then she said "It's timefor bed" She told me she worked In the morning and started to laugh Itold her I didn't And crawled off to sleep in the bath</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>And when I awoke I was alone This bird had flown So I lit a fireIsn't it good Norwegian wood?</p></blockquote><p>歌词的寓意很明显：这个女孩喜欢男孩，想和他滚床单，男孩激动地陪她喝酒聊天。等他早上醒来的时候，发现女孩已经走了，本来在他手里的鸟飞走了，好似喝醉后的一场梦，转瞬无影踪。可是Norwegian wood为什么莫名其妙出现在这里？</p><h2 id="故事">故事</h2><p>这首歌基本上是John Lennon完成的，歌词原本是<strong>Isn't good?Knowing she would</strong>创作完成后，唱片公司觉得歌词的意味太明显，在60年代这样的歌词有些太过直白。唱片公司要求John修改歌词，调皮的John就利用谐音把<strong>Knowing shewould</strong>改成了<strong>Norwegian wood</strong>改完之后，起初录音时候他还是唱<strong>Knowing shewould</strong>，于是唱片公司下了最后通牒：如果还这样唱，那这首歌不能收录。就这样，John Lennon唱出了<strong>Norwegianwood</strong>，村上听着<strong>Norwegianwood</strong>写出了<strong>Norwegian wood</strong>。</p>]]></content>

ofOverfitting</h2><p><imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190320163616569.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L0VJTWFkcmlnYWw=,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70"alt="在这里插入图片描述"

/><br />欠拟合（high bias）：模型不能很好地适应训练集；<br />过拟合（highvariance）：模型过于强调拟合原始数据，测试时效果会比较差。<br />处理过拟合：<br />1、丢弃一些特征，包括人工丢弃和算法选择；<br />2、正则化：保留所有特征，但减小参数的值。</p><h2 id="二cost-function">二、Cost Function</h2><p>过拟合一般是由高次项引起，那么我们可以通过增加某些项的cost，来降低它们的权重。<br />在梯度下降过程中，要使损失函数变小，那么<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>就会变得很小，所以假设函数中的<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>就会变小，该项的权重就会降低。</p><p>如果不知道要惩罚哪些特征，可以一起惩罚（除了<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta_0\)</span>）。<br />将代价函数改为：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190320165635129.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br /><span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>是正则化参数。<br />如果<spanclass="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>过大，那么所有的参数都会最小化，那么假设就会变为<spanclass="math inline">\(h_\theta(x)=\theta_0\)</span>，造成欠拟合。</p><h2 id="三regularized-linear-regression">三、Regularized LinearRegression</h2><p><spanclass="math inline">\(\theta_0\)</span>没有正则化处理，所以梯度下降要分情况：<br /><imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190320170642494.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L0VJTWFkcmlnYWw=,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />化简下：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190320170825316.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />可以看到：<br />正则化后的参数更新比原来多减小了一个值。</p><p>再看线性回归的另外一个工具：常规方程。<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190320171502423.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />推导过程省略......</p><h2 id="四regularized-logistic-regression">四、Regularized LogisticRegression</h2><p>对于逻辑回归的代价函数，同样增加一个正则化表达式：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2019032019010815.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />梯度下降算法与线性回归相同，不过<spanclass="math inline">\(h_\theta(x)\)</span>不同。<br /><imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190320190430424.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L0VJTWFkcmlnYWw=,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /></p><h2 id="一evaluating-a-learning-algorithm">一、Evaluating a LearningAlgorithm</h2><p>训练后测试时如果发现模型表现很差，可以有很多种方法去更改：</p><ol type="1"><li>用更多的训练样本；</li><li>减少/增加特征数目；</li><li>尝试多项式特征；</li><li>增大/减小正则化参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>。</li></ol><p>那么该怎么去选择采用哪种方式呢？<br />一般将70%的数据作为训练集，30%的数据作为测试集。<br />先用训练集最小化<spanclass="math inline">\(J_{train}(\Theta)\)</span>，得到一组参数值<spanclass="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span>；<br />然后计算测试集误差<spanclass="math inline">\(J_{test}(\Theta)\)</span>：<br />对于<strong>线性回归</strong>：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190603210422113.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />对于<strong>逻辑回归</strong>：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190603210631921.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />测试集的平均误差（分类错误的比率）：<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190603210807680.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />假设要选择用几次多项式<spanclass="math inline">\(d\)</span>去作为假设函数，那么做法就是不断尝试<spanclass="math inline">\(d\)</span>，选择一个在测试集上损失最小的<spanclass="math inline">\(d\)</span>，以此作为模型泛化能力的衡量。但是这样是有问题的，因为<spanclass="math inline">\(d\)</span>相当于是被测试集训练的，再用测试集去测试，很不公平。所以一般将数据集分为3部分：60%训练集、20%交叉验证集、20%测试集：<br

/></p><p>## 四、Handling Skewed Data如果数据集中正负类的数据规模差距过大，只用误差衡量模型是不可靠的，此时需要查准率和召回率两个指标。<br /><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190605104947575.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /><br />如何权衡这两个指标，一般使用<spanclass="math inline">\(F1\)</span>得分： <spanclass="math display">\[F_1=2\frac{PR}{P+R}\]</span></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>If y only takes a finite set of discrete values such as {0,1}, thenusing Linear Regression to predict a <span class="math inline">\(\haty&gt;1/\hat y&lt;0\)</span> does not make sense at all. But fortunatelywe can fix Linear Regression to produce a value between [0,1].</p><h2 id="details">Details</h2><p>We choose sigmoid/logistic function to map the value: <spanclass="math display">\[h_\theta(x)=g(\theta^Tx),g(z)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\]</span><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190516212200143.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> We can assume that: <spanclass="math display">\[h_\theta(x)=P(y=1|x;\theta)\\1-h_\theta(x)=P(y=0|x;\theta)\]</span> Or more compactly: <spanclass="math display">\[p(y|x;\theta)=[h_\theta(x)]^y[1-h_\theta(x)]^{1-y}\]</span>Now we will use maximum likelihood to fit parameters <spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, assume n training examples areindependent, then the likelihood of the parameters is: <spanclass="math display">\[L(\theta)=p(\vecy|X;\theta)=\prod_{i=1}^{n}p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)};\theta)=\prod_{i=1}^{n}[h(x^{(i)})]^{y^{(i)}}[1-h(x^{(i)})]^{1-y^{(i)}}\]</span>To make life easier, we use the log likelihood: <spanclass="math display">\[l(\theta)=log\L(\theta)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}y^{(i)}log\ h(x^{(i)})+(1-y^{(i)})log\(1-h(x^{(i)}))\]</span> Let's first take out one example <spanclass="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> to derive the stochastic gradientascent rule: <spanclass="math display">\[\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_j}l(\theta)=[y\frac{1}{g(\theta^Tx)}-(1-y)\frac{1}{1-g(\theta^Tx)}]\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_j}g(\theta^Tx)\\=[y\frac{1}{g(\theta^Tx)}-(1-y)\frac{1}{1-g(\theta^Tx)}]g(\theta^Tx)(1-g(\theta^Tx))\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_j}\theta^Tx\\=[y(1-g(\theta^Tx))-(1-y)g(\theta^Tx)]x_j=(y-h_\theta(x))x_j\]</span>Then we can update the parameters: <spanclass="math display">\[\theta_j=\theta_j+\alpha(y^{(i)}-h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}))x_j^{(i)}\]</span></p><p>Here we use maximum likelihood to get the update rule. Generally wewould like to minimize the object function. So we can add a negativesign to the maximum likelihood's formula, it is called <strong>logisticloss</strong>. Thus there exists another way to understand it.</p><p>The loss on a single sample can be formulated as follows: <spanclass="math display">\[cost(h_{\theta}(x),y)=\left\{\begin{aligned}-log(h_{\theta}(x))\ \ \ if\ y=1\\-log(1-h_{\theta}(x))\ \ \ if\ y=0\end{aligned}\right.\]</span> If y=1 and the prediction=1, then loss=0; else if y=1 and theprediction=0, then loss=<span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span> isa huge penalty for the totally wrong prediction. It is the same fory=0.</p><p>We can unify the two cases together and the loss for the wholetraining data is: <span class="math display">\[cost((h_{\theta}(x),y))=-ylog(h_{\theta}(x))-(1-y)log(1-h_{\theta}(x))\\=-\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}[y^{(i)}log(h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}))+(1-y^{(i)})log(1-h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}))]\]</span> Here the reason why we don't use the MSE loss such as LinearRegression is that the <span class="math inline">\(J(\theta)\)</span> isnon-convex and very hard to optimize for the global optimum.</p><p>To make life easier again, we can write the formula as the vectorizedversion: <span class="math display">\[h = g(X\theta),J(\theta) =\frac{1}{m} \cdot \left(-y^{T}\log(h)-(1-y)^{T}\log(1-h)\right)\]</span>Then our goal is to minimize <spanclass="math inline">\(J(\theta)\)</span> and get appropriate parameters<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and use <spanclass="math inline">\(h_\theta(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-\theta^Tx}}\)</span> toget our predictions.</p><p>Since it is a little complex to get answer analytically, so we stilluse Gradient Descent to minimize the loss numerically. The update ruleis the same as the above one: <span class="math display">\[\theta_j=\theta_j+\alpha\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(y^{(i)}-h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}))x_j^{(i)}\]</span> Here you should notice that all <spanclass="math inline">\(\theta_j\)</span> should be updated simultaneouslywhen you program. Again the vectorized version: <spanclass="math display">\[\theta=\theta-\frac{\alpha}{m}X^T[g(X\theta)-y]\]</span>It is the same formula as the Linear Regression except that <spanclass="math inline">\(h_\theta(x)\)</span> is different.</p><h2 id="牛顿法">牛顿法</h2><p>除了用梯度上升法去最大化<spanclass="math inline">\(l(\theta)\)</span>，牛顿迭代法也能干这件事。</p><p>普通同学都是在求方程的零点<spanclass="math inline">\(f(\theta)=0\)</span>时接触到牛顿法，其更新规则为：<spanclass="math display">\[\theta=\theta-\frac{f(\theta)}{f^{&#39;}(\theta)}\]</span>这个规则可以理解为：我们一直在用一个线性函数去近似<spanclass="math inline">\(f\)</span>，因此希望下一次迭代的<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>就是该线性函数的零点： <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210616190823439.png"alt="在这里插入图片描述" /> 再结合一点高中数学，<spanclass="math inline">\(l(\theta)\)</span>极大值点处的一阶导数为0，因此只要令<spanclass="math inline">\(l^{&#39;}(\theta)=0\)</span>就能解出对应的<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>： <spanclass="math display">\[\theta=\theta-\frac{l^{&#39;}(\theta)}{l^{&#39;&#39;}(\theta)}\]</span>由于逻辑回归中<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>是向量而非scalar，因此需要稍稍改变下更新规则：<spanclass="math display">\[\theta=\theta-H^{-1}\nabla_{\theta}l(\theta)\]</span>其中，Hessian阵中的元素为<spanclass="math inline">\(H_{ij}=\frac{\partial^2l(\theta)}{\partial\theta_i\partial\theta_j}\)</span>。</p><p>牛顿法通常比梯度上升收敛快得多，因为利用了<spanclass="math inline">\(l(\theta)\)</span>的二阶信息，但是存储和求解<spanclass="math inline">\(H^{-1}\)</span>开销会比较大。</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="线性回归模型">线性回归模型</h2><p><spanclass="math display">\[h_{\theta}(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{d}\theta_ix_i=\theta^Tx=x^T\theta\]</span>其中，<span class="math inline">\(x_0=1\)</span>，<spanclass="math inline">\(d\)</span>表示<spanclass="math inline">\(x\)</span>的特征数量。</p><p>在给定训练集下，需要用学习算法确定参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>，使得模型的预测值<spanclass="math inline">\(h(x)\)</span>与真实值<spanclass="math inline">\(y\)</span>尽可能接近。为了精确地描述这种接近程度，定义损失函数：<spanclass="math display">\[J(\theta)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(h_{\theta}(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2\]</span>问题转化为选择一组<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>使得<spanclass="math inline">\(J(\theta)\)</span>最小，这里有2种求解方法：</p><ol type="1"><li>梯度下降</li><li>Normal Equation</li></ol><h2 id="梯度下降">梯度下降</h2><p>梯度下降的motivation非常直观，首先随机选择一组参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>，接着沿<spanclass="math inline">\(J(\theta)\)</span>下降最快的方向更新<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>，经过若干次迭代就有望找到令<spanclass="math inline">\(J(\theta)\)</span>收敛的参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>： <spanclass="math display">\[\theta_j=\theta_j-\alpha\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_j}J(\theta)\]</span>将<spanclass="math inline">\(J(\theta)\)</span>的偏导数代入即得到所谓的batchgradient descent更新规则： <spanclass="math display">\[\theta_j=\theta_j-\alpha\sum_{i=1}^{n}(h_\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)}\]</span>其向量化表示为： <spanclass="math display">\[\theta=\theta-\alpha\sum_{i=1}^{n}(h_\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})x^{(i)}\]</span>由于损失函数<spanclass="math inline">\(J(\theta)\)</span>是凸二次函数，因此总能收敛到唯一的全局最小值。</p><p>batch gradientdescent一次更新需要计算所有训练样本，开销较大，因此有同学提出了stochasticgradient descent，每遇到一个训练样本就进行一次参数更新： <spanclass="math display">\[\theta=\theta-\alpha(h_\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})x^{(i)}\]</span>stochastic gradient descent一般比batch gradientdescent收敛快，但是有可能在<spanclass="math inline">\(J(\theta)\)</span>的最优点附近振荡，永远无法收敛到精确最优。不过一般选择最优点附近的参数也可以接受，还可以通过递减学习率<spanclass="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>确保其精确收敛。</p><p>值得一提的是：梯度下降算法存在“锯齿”效应，因此为了加速收敛，通常要进行归一化处理使得不同特征的尺度相近。</p><h2 id="normal-equation">Normal Equation</h2><p>除了用迭代的方式求解<spanclass="math inline">\(J(\theta)\)</span>的最小值，还可以用数学工具直接求得闭式解。</p><p>为了简洁地表示后续求导，使得人生不要太过凌乱，我们首先研究下<spanclass="math inline">\(J(\theta)\)</span>的向量表示：<br />假设训练集<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>和对应的标签<spanclass="math inline">\(y\)</span>分别为： <spanclass="math display">\[X=\left[\begin{matrix}(x^{(1)})^T \\(x^{(2)})^T \\\vdots \\(x^{(n)})^T \\\end{matrix}\right],y=\left[\begin{matrix}y^{(1)} \\y^{(2)} \\\vdots \\y^{(n)} \\\end{matrix}\right]\]</span> 由于<spanclass="math inline">\(h_{\theta}(x^{(i)})=(x^{(i)})^T\theta\)</span>，所以有：<span class="math display">\[X\theta-y=\left[\begin{matrix}(x^{(1)})^T\theta \\(x^{(2)})^T\theta \\\vdots \\(x^{(n)})^T\theta \\\end{matrix}\right]-\left[\begin{matrix}y^{(1)} \\y^{(2)} \\\vdots \\y^{(n)} \\\end{matrix}\right]=\left[\begin{matrix}h_{\theta}(x^{(1)})-y^{(1)}  \\h_{\theta}(x^{(2)})-y^{(2)} \\\vdots \\h_{\theta}(x^{(n)})-y^{(n)} \\\end{matrix}\right]\]</span> 根据向量运算法则<spanclass="math inline">\(x^Tx=\sum_ix_i^2\)</span>，终于得到了<spanclass="math inline">\(J(\theta)\)</span>的简单点的表示： <spanclass="math display">\[\frac{1}{2}(X\theta-y)^T(X\theta-y)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(h_{\theta}(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2=J(\theta)\]</span>利用高中数学导数的知识，只要求得<spanclass="math inline">\(J(\theta)\)</span>关于参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>的导数并令其为0，就大功告成了：<spanclass="math display">\[\nabla_{\theta}J(\theta)=\frac{1}{2}(X\theta-y)^T(X\theta-y)\\=\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\theta}[(X\theta)^TX\theta-(X\theta)^Ty-y^T(X\theta)+y^Ty]=\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\theta}[\theta^T(X^TX)\theta-y^T(X\theta)-y^T(X\theta)]\\=\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\theta}[\theta^T(X^TX)\theta-2(X^Ty)^T\theta]=\frac{1}{2}(2X^TX\theta-2X^Ty)=X^TX\theta-X^Ty\]</span>哦，高中数学好像不太够，还要知道<spanclass="math inline">\(a^Tb=b^Ta,\nabla_{x}Ax=A^T,\nabla_{x}x^TAx=(A+A^T)x\)</span>。</p><p>结束了无聊的数学推导，所谓的Normal Equation就来了： <spanclass="math display">\[X^TX\theta=X^Ty\]</span> 我们暂时先不考虑<spanclass="math inline">\(X^TX\)</span>不可逆的情况，最终的解析解就是<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta=(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty\)</span>。这种方法不需要做FeatureScaling，但是只能用于容易求解的模型。</p><h2 id="probabilistic-view">Probabilistic view</h2><p>当观测数据满足一些假设条件时，就可以自然而然地推导出均方误差形式的损失函数。</p><p>假设观测数据满足： <spanclass="math display">\[y^{(i)}=\theta^Tx^{(i)}+\epsilon^{(i)}\]</span>其中，<spanclass="math inline">\(\epsilon^{(i)}\)</span>表示偏差项，并且<spanclass="math inline">\(\epsilon^{(i)}\)</span>服从IID的高斯分布，即<spanclass="math inline">\(\epsilon^{(i)}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)\)</span>。</p><p>在满足上述假设的条件下，给定<spanclass="math inline">\(x^{(i)}\)</span>，观测到的<spanclass="math inline">\(y^{(i)}\)</span>满足概率分布<spanclass="math inline">\(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)};\theta\sim\mathcal{N}(\theta^Tx^{(i)}, \sigma^2)\)</span>，即： <spanclass="math display">\[p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)};\theta)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}exp(-\frac{(y^{(i)}-\theta^Tx^{(i)})^2}{2 \sigma^2})\]</span>我们希望选择合适的参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>，使得在整个训练集上最大化观测数据出现的概率，也就是所谓的极大似然估计：<spanclass="math display">\[\prod_{i=1}^{n}p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)};\theta)=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}exp(-\frac{(y^{(i)}-\theta^Tx^{(i)})^2}{2\sigma^2})=L(\theta)\]</span> To make our lifeeasier，采用对数似然函数的形式去求<spanclass="math inline">\(L(\theta)\)</span>的最大值： <spanclass="math display">\[l(\theta)=log\ L(\theta)=nlog\\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n(y^{(i)}-\theta^Tx^{(i)})^2\]</span>因此，最大化<span class="math inline">\(L(\theta)\)</span>与最小化<spanclass="math inline">\(J(\theta)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(h_{\theta}(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2\)</span>等价，也就证明了均方误差损失函数的合理性。</p><p>值得一提的是：上述假设并不唯一，存在其它合理的假设同样能够证明均方误差作为损失函数的合理性。</p><h2 id="局部加权线性回归">局部加权线性回归</h2><p>在朴素的线性回归中，训练模型得到的参数<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>是固定的，对于每个要预测的点<spanclass="math inline">\(x\)</span>计算<spanclass="math inline">\(\theta^Tx\)</span>就完事了。这种参数化的学习算法在预测时不需要训练数据的支持，非常快捷。</p><p>局部加权线性回归的motivation在于：朴素线性模型强行拟合所有训练样本，因为模型简单往往欠拟合。对于任意一个样本<spanclass="math inline">\(x\)</span>，如果只根据其周围几个样本来建立局部的线性模型，且距离<spanclass="math inline">\(x\)</span>越近其在损失函数中的权值越大，就得到了所谓的LocallyWeighted Linear Regression： <spanclass="math display">\[J(\theta)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}w^{(i)}(h_{\theta}(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2\]</span>直观上看：如果一个点权值较大，其对损失函数的贡献就越大；如果权值较小，那么该点基本可以忽略不计。</p><p>权值一般会设计为指数函数： <spanclass="math display">\[w^{(i)}=exp(-\frac{(x^{(i)}-x)^T(x^{(i)}-x)}{2\tau^2})\]</span>其中，<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>表示待测试样本，<spanclass="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>负责控制随距离增加权值的衰减快慢。</p><p>另外，与kNN类似，LWR也是一种懒惰学习算法，即只有给出测试样例时才会训练并预测。因此，这种非参数算法在预测时需要存储训练集，并且参数数量会随训练集大小线性增长。</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="decision-tree">Decision Tree</h2><h2 id="details">Details</h2><p>决策树的发展经历了CART(Classification and Regression Tree), ID3,C4.5等多个阶段：<br />CART是一种二叉树，分类树采用基尼系数，回归树采用平方误差。<br />ID3主要用于分类，是一种多叉树结构，采用信息增益。<br />C4.5主要用于分类，是一种多叉树结构，采用信息增益比。<br />最终的模型为： <span class="math display">\[f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{m}C_iI(x\inR_i),I(x\in R_i)=\begin{cases}1, &amp; \text{x$\in$ $R_i$}  \\0, &amp; \text{else}\end{cases}\]</span> m表示数据集被划分的子集数目，<spanclass="math inline">\(C_i\)</span>表示第i个单元的输出值 ## Example ##Implementation ## Properties</p><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>Random Forest is some kind of ensemble learning method, just as itsname indicates. The base learner is decision tree and RF uses Bagging tointegrate. The difference mainly lies in the word 'Random'. The originaldecision tree selects the best attribute while RF has two steps toselect a split attribute for each base learner:</p><ul><li>Select k attributes from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>randomly;</li><li>Select the best attribute from the k attributes. If k=1 then it'stotal random selection; If k=<span class="math inline">\(|A|\)</span>then it's the same as decision tree. The recommended is <spanclass="math inline">\(k=log_2|A|\)</span>.</li></ul><p>The intuition behind this is to increase the diversity of the baselearners. In original bagging method we just use the sample disturbanceof the training data. But in RF we add the attribute disturbance thusmaking the learner generalize very well.</p><p>As you can imagine, RF's performance is worse than Bagging during theearly time of the training process. Since we just use a subset of theattributes so the base learner performs not that well. But with theincrease of the number of base learners, it will gradually use the wholeinformation and then has a low generation error. By the way, RF is oftenfaster than Bagging since we only use a subset to train the baselearners.</p><h2 id="随机森林回归">随机森林回归</h2><p>决策树回归的叶子结点代表一小片区域，落入该区域的训练样例的均值被用来作为该区域的预测值：<br /><imgsrc="https://img2020.cnblogs.com/blog/1260581/202111/1260581-20211102104210878-1445042394.png"alt="image" /><br />例如上图中右下角的叶子结点的值552.899就是落入该区域的5个样本的均值。<br />随机森林则是由若干棵决策树通过某些“随机”的方式构建而成，包括样本随机和属性随机，最终的预测结果由所有树的平均得到。<br />但是它不像线性回归那样在预测时可以外推，如果仔细观察最终参与决策的树的某一部分：<br /><imgsrc="https://img2020.cnblogs.com/blog/1260581/202111/1260581-20211102105550016-162430821.png"alt="image" /><br />可以看到：在carat&lt;0.905和z&lt;3.915这个区域共有4个训练样本，因此测试集中任意一个落入此区域的样本都会被预测为4个样本的均值2775.75，自然也就不会超过这4个样本的取值极限。<br />如果要预测某个targetvalue超出训练集极限的样例，其预测结果仍然是训练集中某些样本的均值。</p><p>缺失值处理：我在科研中见到的都是先用常数填充训练数据和测试数据，再去扔给模型训练和预测。<br />我使用sklearn中标准的RandomForestRegressor进行了尝试，如果训练数据包含缺失值，那么训练将会报错。## Example ## Implementation ## Properties ## Refs <ahref="https://neptune.ai/blog/random-forest-regression-when-does-it-fail-and-why">RandomForest Regression: When Does It Fail and Why?</a></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>最近面试有被问到LTE，感觉说得不太清楚，重新整理一遍。</p><h2 id="第一代移动通信系统">第一代移动通信系统</h2><p>1G，诞生于1980年左右。<strong>模拟通信系统</strong>，抗干扰性能差，使用FDMA技术，主要用来传输<strong>话音</strong>信号，最拉风的就是“大哥大”。<br />采用蜂窝组网，又叫小区制移动通信。将网络服务区划分为许多cell，每个cell设置一个基站，移动站的发送和接收都要通过基站进行。<br />1G的制式有很多种：瑞士、荷兰、俄罗斯等使用的NMT，美国、澳大利亚使用的AMPS，英国使用的TACS等。</p><h2 id="第二代移动通信系统">第二代移动通信系统</h2><p>2G是<strong>数字通信系统</strong>，因此抗干扰能力大大增强。同时引入了CDMA和TDMA技术，提供了<strong>低速数字通信</strong>（短信）服务。<br />2G的制式主要是欧洲的GSM(Global System for Mobile Communication)。<br />不久，2G就演变为了支持<strong>数据服务</strong>的2.5G（能上网）。2.5G包括了GPRS(GeneralPacket Radio Service)和EDGE(Enhanced Data rate for GSM Evolution)。</p><h2 id="第三代移动通信系统">第三代移动通信系统</h2><p>3G主要采用了CDMA技术，使用混合的交换机制（电路交换、分组交换），可以提供丰富的多媒体服务（话音、数据、视频等）。<br />3G的标准主要有三种：欧洲的WCDMA（中国联通采用）、美国的CDMA2000（中国电信使用）、中国的TD-SCDMA（中国移动使用）。<br />制定标准的过程也是利益冲突与妥协的过程，欧洲这边成立了3GPP组织，美国主导了3GPP2组织，中国当然是加入了3GPP。</p><h2 id="第四代移动通信系统">第四代移动通信系统</h2><p>国际电信联盟（ITU）提出了4G的需求，4G的大名是IMT-Advanced(InternationalMobile Telecommunications-Advanced)。<br />4G标准的制定者，一个是3GPP，一个是IEEE。<br />3GPP提出了LTE(Long-TermEvolution)和LTE-Advanced，IEEE提出了WirelessMAN-Advanced。<br />LTE是3G和4G之间的过渡技术，也被称为3.9G。由于高通放弃了3GPP2转而投向LTE的怀抱，所以LTE应用得很广泛。</p><p>LTE相比于2G/3G频率变高、频段变宽，根据香农定理，提高频谱带宽或者信噪比可以提高信道容量，但是无线通信中要提升信噪比是比较困难的。高频段频谱资源丰富，相对低频段来说比较纯净，干扰较小，可分配的带宽比较大，同频段的连续频谱进行载波聚合也比较容易。</p><p>缺点的话：高频段路径损耗大、绕射能力差，因此覆盖距离和覆盖深度都不如低频段，当然频段过低可能造成越区覆盖，进而信噪比恶化，切换失败导致掉话。因此需要频段适中来组网。</p><p>EPC(Evolved Packet Core)：<ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/22365275/answer/21805286">演进的分组核心网</a>是4G的核心网，</p><p>PTN(Packet TransportNetwork)：3G/4G的分组传送网，用于传输IP包和以太网帧，</p><p>数据通信网络：</p><h2 id="部分部门内网禁止访问互联网">部分部门内网禁止访问互联网</h2><p><imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/b40f033d64a74b91bb7c24677814398a.png"alt="网络拓扑结构" />假设一台PC机为普通部门，可以接入外网；另一台PC机为涉密部门，不能接入外网。两台PC机与三层交换机连接，三层交换机与路由器1连接，路由器通过PTN传输与能连接公网的路由器2连接。<br />可接入外网的PC机在三层交换机当中有路由表，可以通过PTN传输与公网连接，禁止接入外网的PC机无法查到路由表，不能与公网连接。<br />配置三层交换机与两个路由器。路由器通过PTN传输与另一台能访问公网的路由器相连接。</p><p>同一部门位于相同的子网段设置为同一VLAN互通，不同的部门位于不同的网段通过三层交换机的路由功能，实现不同VLAN间互通。</p><p>在配置三层交换机与路由器R1的OSPF协议时，私密部门的网段不加入路由协议中。</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>菊厂的面试本来没打算记录，因为当时投的是非技术岗（技术支持）。为了全面，就寥做记录。</em><em>菊厂的面试因为有口头保密协议，所以不能透露具体题目。</em></p><h1 id="群面">0 群面</h1><p>简历通过筛选后，会有短信通知去面试。非技术岗第一轮是所谓“集体面试”，持续1.5h，菊厂两种形式：小组讨论（6人及以下）、小组辩论（12人分2组，6人/组）。小组讨论一般是3位面试官会给一个问题，要求讨论之后给出一个解决方案；小组辩论在分好组之后，会有一个简短的自我介绍环节；接着拿到辩题，会有15~20Min左右的组内讨论时间；讨论完毕后，每组需要选一个发言人阐述本方论点（建议口才不是很好的同学不要抢这个发言人）；再下来就是针对对方的论点论据进行辩论（这时候一定要积极举手回答）；最后会让每个人选一个要淘汰的本组同学并阐明理由，之后面试官进行总结。群面结束后，没有通过的人就可以回家了。我其实比较讨厌辩论，感觉就是两组人围绕着两个极端去互相反驳对方，可是明明很多时候是完全可以trade-off的，并不是非此即彼。</p><h1 id="半技术面">1 半技术面</h1><p>之所以叫做半技术面，是因为菊厂非技术岗的二面有点XX。据说会根据你的专业背景提问，如果不太对口就不会提问技术问题。很不幸，我的面试官原来也是学通信的。简单聊了下简历上的项目之后，就开始疯狂追问网络问题，我可能没太get到他的point，交流不太顺畅，这一面表现不太好。不过不知道是不是因为长太帅了（捂脸~），这一面竟然给过了。</p><h1 id="高管面">2 高管面</h1><p>通过二面后，会把你请到一个逼格有点高的地方，等着被高管临幸。这种聊的就比较随意了，侃天侃地侃人生。你的人生有嘛规划啊，你遇到最大的挫折是嘛啊，怎么克服的啊，你了解华为公司嘛......如果要把你派到非洲，愿不愿意啊，三年你愿意，十年你愿意么？总之，华为的文化就是你要绝对服从公司的安排，不怕吃苦，不怕牺牲，为公司倾情奉献。。。最后你有什么问题的话，可以问他。</p><h1 id="英语测试">3 英语测试</h1><p>如果通过前三轮面试，最后有一个英语测试。这个不知道什么标准，反正差不多三部分：1、单选题；2、朗读句子？（记不清了）；3、给2个topic，说一段话。我这感人的口语水平，第三部分噼里啪啦自己都不知道说的啥。。。全部完成后，就可以回去等消息了。 P.s.即使四轮面试全部通过，也不意味着就能拿到offer。熟悉菊厂的同学都知道有个资源池，过面试后先进池子里泡着，公司会根据HC和前一批的违约情况从池子里分批捞人，建议不要一棵树上吊死。<em>其它菊厂面经 ：https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/24427674</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>吐槽下ZZ的面试安排：面试时间12：30不说了，周围没有饭店，中午就没吃饭。。。不像其他公司给每个人安排不同的面试时间，这样可以节约大家的时间，SPDB是把一大批人都安排在了12：30，而且面试是5个面试官对一个人，生生地把可以并行的工作给整废了，大部分时间都浪费在了无意义的等待上。</p><h2

id="构造函数和析构函数">构造函数和析构函数</h3><p>析构函数可以并且应当是虚函数，因为要确保执行相应对象的析构函数。如果基类指针指向派生类对象，会调用派生类的析构函数并释放资源，然后调用基类的析构函数。当析构一个指向子类的父类指针时，编译器可以根据虚函数表寻找到子类的析构函数进行调用，从而正确释放子类对象的资源。否则<code>delete animal</code>时调用<code>Animal</code>的析构函数，<code>Dog</code>的资源未释放。如果析构函数不被声明成虚函数，则编译器实施静态绑定，在删除指向子类的父类指针时，只会调用父类的析构函数而不调用子类析构函数，这样就会造成子类对象析构不完全造成内存泄漏。</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td

一个线程崩溃会导致进程崩溃,从而影响其他线程.</li></ol><p>协程即微线程：协程就是子程序在执行时中断并转去执行别的子程序，在适当的时候又返回来执行。这种子程序间的跳转不是函数调用，也不是多线程执行，所以省去了线程切换的开销，效率很高，并且不需要多线程间的锁机制，不会发生变量写冲突。</p><p>协程进行中断跳转时将函数的上下文存放在其他位置中，而不是存放在函数堆栈里，当处理完其他事情跳转回来的时候，取回上下文继续执行原来的函数。</p><p>线程：频繁创建销毁，需要大量计算，切换频繁，IO密集型<br />进程：稳定安全，CPU密集型</p><p><ahref="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/204965836">协程由来和概念</a><br /><ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/50185085/answer/183463734">协程诞生</a><br /><ahref="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/169426477">线程和协程的区别</a></p><h3 id="通信方式">通信方式</h3><p>进程间通信：</p><ul><li>管道</li><li>信号量</li><li>消息队列</li><li>信号</li><li>共享内存</li><li>套接字：<ahref="https://www.cnblogs.com/vonyao/p/3614320.html">本地socket</a></li></ul><p>线程间通信：</p><ul><li>锁机制：互斥锁 + 条件变量，读写锁</li><li>全局变量：在各线程共享的堆上，每个线程私有栈</li><li>事件event：有信号和无信号两种状态</li><li>Semaphore</li></ul><p>互斥锁用来保证线程间的互斥，条件变量控制线程间执行顺序。比如生产者消费者中，缓冲区作为共享资源每次只能有一个线程访问，线程只有获取互斥锁才能访问，<br />然而生产者访问并生产后，消费者并不知道何时缓冲区才有物品，故需要条件变量通知消费者，消费者无需忙等。<br />假如只有mutex没有cv，那么可能有忙等；<ahref="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12551341/when-is-a-condition-variable-needed-isnt-a-mutex-enough">isn'ta mutex enough?</a><br />假如只有cv没有mutex，<ahref="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2763714/why-do-pthreads-condition-variable-functions-require-a-mutex">Whycondition variable require a mutex?</a><br /><ahref="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/55123862">条件变量之稀里糊涂的锁</a></p><h3 id="zombie-orphan-process">Zombie &amp;

Itdoesn't matter you learn it slowly, the most important part is that you<strong>take it seriously</strong> and build a <strong>solidfoundation</strong>.<br />根据大佬们的经验，一门课大概要花150-300小时，每天2小时至少也要2个半月，所以千万千万不要着急，不要急于求成，总想着完成任务，多多反思自己到底学到了什么？真的透彻地理解了吗？又有多少内化到自身的知识体系？<br />还有就是最好按照他们的课表时间上课，同时上的课最好不要超过2门（经过血泪实践，我只能1门单线程┭┮﹏┭┮，他们课程内容实在太充实了...，然后自己还有一堆屁事...）</p><p><strong>严格遵守学术规范</strong>，独立完成之后可以参考别人，修正自己。</p><p>Recently I've changed my way to learn new things. Previously I justwanted to understand the new things and tried to memorize all thedetails of a specific problem, or just translated others' materials intomy words, which melted my brain and showed a very low efficiency. Thereason why I learn things this way (passively) is mostly due to theChinese's cramming education. But for me, heuristic teaching (actively)is more appropriate. The specific problem/model/algorithm is important,but the <strong>motivation</strong> is much more important.<strong>Everything has its motivation.</strong> So I decide to write myblogs with the following components:</p><ol type="1"><li>Motivation: What problems do we meet? Why propose this one?</li><li>Details: Mathematical derivation or tricky things.</li><li>Example: Use a handy example to illustrate.</li><li>Implementation: Code it out or use it to <strong>solve theproblem</strong>.</li><li>Properties: <strong>When</strong> should/can we use the method? Whenshouldn't/can't? <strong>Why</strong>? What's the benefits and drawbacksif we use it?</li><li>Can we make some improvements on the off-the-shelf method for aspecific problem?</li></ol><h2 id="done-list">DONE LIST</h2><p>Count the courses I've taken so far:</p><ol type="1"><li>Introduction to Computer Science. Harvard University<br />"This is CS 50". It should be the first class of CS rather than HaoqiangTan's C Programming Language.</li><li>Linear Algebra. Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br />If you want to learn Linear Algebra, just follow this one and you'll befine.</li><li>Mathematics for Computer Science. Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology<br />Very interesting course but I only took several lectures. SAD~</li><li>Data Structures. University of California, Berkeley<br />Strong recommend for Data Structure. You'll pick up Java from theinteresting projects.</li><li>Introduction to Computer Systems. Carnegie Mellon University<br />If you only want to take one system course, then select this one. But Ihaven't finished the whole lectures and labs. SAD again~</li><li>Introduction to Database Systems. Carnegie Mellon University<br />Hard for me. Just finished lab1. I'll come back one day~</li><li>Machine Learning. Stanford University<br />It's almost the first course I took after I found the true CS courses.But I forgot a lot. Sorry Andrew~</li><li>Positive Psychology. Harvard University<br />When I start to be anxious or depressed I'll go and find the lecture.Tal is an amazing teacher and I'm sure you'll become happier.</li><li>Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. StanfordUniversity<br />High quality, especially its readings.</li><li>Introduction to Computer Networking. Stanford University<br />Lab is amazing!</li></ol>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TCP是面向连接的协议，其数据传输过程分为建立连接、数据传送、释放连接三个阶段。## 0 建立连接 建立连接的过程也就是常说的“三次握手”：</p><ul><li>客户端向服务器端发送一个SYN报文（SYN=1表示这是一个连接请求或连接接收报文），并随机选取一个起始序号x；</li><li>服务器端应答一个SYN报文，同时ACK（确认位）置1【ACK=1时TCP报文段首部中的ack（确认号字段）才有效】，随机选取一个服务器端的起始序号y，并将ack字段设为x+1，表示已经收到客户端发来的SYN报文，期待收到序号为x+1的下一个报文；</li><li>客户端应答一个ACK报文，将序号设为x+1，并且ack字段设为y+1，表示已经收到服务器端的SYN报文，期待收到序号为y+1的下一个报文。</li></ul><p><em>注：序列号seq也称ISN(Initial Sequence Number)</em> <imgsrc="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190920214108996.png"alt="图片来自百度" /><br />之所以要采用三次握手机制而不是两次或四次，要从握手机制的目的说起：<br />握手主要是为了确认<strong>双方的发送、接收能力</strong>是否正常，顺带初始化序号seq，为以后的数据传送做好准备，所以：<br />第一次握手：服务器收到客户端发来的网络包，<strong>服务器就明白</strong>客户端的发送能力、服务器的接收能力正常；<br />第二次握手：服务器发包，客户端收到后，<strong>客户端就明白</strong>服务器的发送、接收，客户端的发送、接收都是正常的；<br />二次握手后，客户端倒是全明白了，但是<strong>服务器端无法确认客户端能否正常接收、服务器是否正常发送</strong>，所以两次握手不够；<br />第三次握手：服务器收到客户端发送的网络包，服务器确认了自己上次的发送正常、客户端接收也正常，所以四次握手是多余的。</p><h2 id="补充问题">1 补充问题</h2><ul><li>序列号(ISN)之所以随机生成，是为了避免被攻击（若固定，则下一次传送的ack就显而易见）；</li><li>前两次握手不可以携带数据，第三次可以携带。第一次握手服务器端接收能力未知，如果携带数据就可能丢失。第二次客户端接收能力未知，如果携带数据也可能丢失。第三次客户端知道服务器接收正常，并且自己已经处于ESTABLISHED状态；</li><li>服务器发出SYN报文后，处于SYN-RCVD状态，此时不同的连接请求会被放在<strong>半连接队列</strong>里，三次握手完成后的连接请求被放在<strong>全连接队列</strong>里。</li></ul><h2 id="连接释放">2 连接释放</h2><p>连接释放的过程也就是常说的“四次挥手”：<br />P.S. <em>图中以客户端发起释放请求为例</em></p><ol type="1"><li>客户端发送释放请求，将FIN（终止位）置1，表示客户端已经发完数据，请求释放；</li><li>服务器发一个ACK报文，确认号ack为u+1，这时从客户端到服务器的连接被释放，处于<strong>半关闭状态</strong>；</li><li>如果服务器也要断开连接，就向客户端发送连接释放报文（FIN=1）；</li><li>客户端发送一个应答报文，序列号seq为u+1，等待一段时间（2MSL）确保服务器收到ACK报文，之后关闭连接。</li></ol><p><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20190920223118842.png"alt="图片源自百度" /><br />客户端之所以要等待2MSL时间才关闭，有两个原因：</p><ul><li>一旦服务器没有收到ACK报文，服务器就会重发FIN报文，客户端再次收到FIN报文，就知道之前发送的ACK报文丢失，会重置时间等待计时器为2MSL并重传ACK报文。<br />如果没有这段等待时间，万一服务器没有正常接收ACK报文，接下来重传的FIN报文段就无法到达客户端，服务器无法正常关闭。</li><li>客户端发完最后一个ACK报文，经过2MSL，本次连接产生的报文都会从网络中消失，避免下一次新连接出现本次旧的连接请求报文段。</li></ul>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="文件io">文件IO</h2><p>在刷题测试程序时，为了避免每次都手工输入，我们可以把输入数据保存在文件中；为了避免输出太长，我们将输出也写入文件中，方便与标准答案文件进行比较。<br />文件使用一般有两种方法：输入输出重定向, fopen。</p><ul><li>重定向<br />这种方法比较简单，只要在main()函数的开始加上如下代码,就可以将标准I/O(键盘输入、屏幕输出)转为读写文件: <figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td

class="built_in">stdout</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></li></ul><p>万一比赛要求标准I/O，而你还想用文件操作来测试代码时，提交时切记删除上述重定向代码。为了避免忘记这茬，可以如下处理：<figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>介绍一下X86、MIPS、ARM三种指令集：</p><h2 id="x86指令集">X86指令集</h2><p>X86指令集是典型的CISC(Complex Instruction Set Computer)指令集。<br />X86指令集外部看起来是CISC指令集，事实上，它是采用类RISC内核，将部分复杂指令通过micro-op模式进行翻译成简单指令，再处理。<br />X86指令集的几个特性</p><ul><li>后向兼容<br />Intel每推出一代新处理器，总会兼容以前处理器的feature。这是由于长期积累的用户习惯和生态环境不容更改，否则没法赚钱了~<br />后向兼容导致指令集愈发庞大、愈发复杂，同时功耗也会比较大，不过由于Intel超高的工艺水平，这都不是事。</li><li>变长指令<br />X86指令集采用变长指令(1-15Bytes)，一般每条指令为2-3Bytes。这样可以提高码字的利用率，但也使得译码以及读取指令时比较复杂，因为不知道一条指令应该读多长。</li><li>多种寻址方式<br />X86指令集可以采用多种寻址方式，比如立即寻址、寄存器寻址、寄存器相对寻址......</li><li>通用寄存器个数有限<br />X86-32的系统有8个通用寄存器，之后X86-64系统扩展到了16个。</li><li>指令执行时，最多只能有一个操作数在内存里，另一个操作数必为立即数或者寄存器。</li><li>由于后向兼容以及类RISC内核，导致功耗增加；同时，有很多复杂的指令利用率很低。</li></ul><h2 id="mips指令集">MIPS指令集</h2><p>MIPS指令集是典型的RISC(Reduced Instruction SetComputer)指令集。<br />精简指令集系统的设计思想就是：把复杂指令集中一些不常用的指令踢出指令集，这些复杂指令由日益强大的软件技术(编译)去实现，这样使得每个指令的流水线分段比较均匀，充分利用了处理器的流水线结构，提高了主频。<br />MIPS指令集以32个寄存器为中心，只能通过<strong>Load/Store</strong>指令访问内存，其余涉及计算的指令都从寄存器堆中读取数据，并且将计算结果写入寄存器堆中。<br />另外，MIPS指令的格式比较规整，所有指令长度一致，指令操作码都在固定的位置；寻址方式、对于每条指令的操作都很简单。<br />那么CISC与RISC的区别是什么呢？<br />最大的区别在于：RISC只能通过<strong>Load/Store</strong>指令访问内存，而CISC指令集则没有这个限制。</p><h2 id="arm指令集">ARM指令集</h2><p>ARM指令集属于RISC指令集，每条指令32位。<br />ARM也有16位的压缩指令集，这是为了避免32位出现的码字浪费，提高运行速度推出的。</p><ul><li>ARM指令由于属于RISC指令集，一般完成的操作比较简单。程序员可以通过多条简单的指令组合实现一个复杂的操作。</li><li>同样的，ARM指令集也是只能通过<strong>Load/Store</strong>指令读取内存中的数据到寄存器，其余的指令只能对寄存器的操作数进行处理。</li><li>大多数指令长度相同，字段位置(尤其是操作码的位置)固定，且具有“条件执行”模式。</li></ul>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>知乎上有这样一个问题：<ahref="https://www.zhihu.com/question/22364825/answer/27255001">如果兔子都在拼命奔跑，是什么给了作为乌龟的你前进的动力？</a><br />随着视野的不断开阔，我们难免怀疑自身前进的意义，曾经有很长一段时间我也深陷其中，直到看到余亦多先生的回答才有所感悟。</p><blockquote><p>我想每个人成长的经历中，都会或多或少曾被“自卑”的情绪所笼罩。我自己就是一个一直纠缠于“失败者”情结的人。</p><p>小时候因为痴肥，体育课上在同学面前抬不起头；搬到大城市，因为口音以及内向的性格，成为全班男生的出气筒；到了高中，进到全省理科实验班，才知道有些学霸的智商，是自己一辈子都无法企及的；初到美国，被身边同学认为是FOB，来自第三世界国家的乡巴佬；混进所谓的世界名校，看到身边一大波牛人，陷入平庸的沮丧；好不容易挤到纽约华尔街，看到名校中选出的所谓“精华”，才开始面对自己综合能力的缺失。</p><p>再回到香港，身边很多投行同事的业务能力与人际能力都远胜于我，只能在高压力的环境下苟延残喘；从乙方转到甲方开始做PE投资后，当跟索罗斯的儿子同桌斗智斗勇时，才能深刻体会“家学渊源”与“赢在起跑线”对一个人的意义。</p><p>由外资换到国企，开始看到体制内藏龙卧虎的主流玩家真正在玩什么，才意识到以前在边缘化外资环境下膨胀出各种不接地气的泡沫有多么可笑；随后开始接触到保险、银行以及其他金融领域的强人们，才知道在整个金融大版图中，十倍百倍于自己原来折腾的小池塘规模的资金，是在做什么。</p><p>分享了上面一大段，其实我想说的，最重要是如下几点：<br />1、就像talich老师在我去斯坦福念书以前赠我的那句话：<br />到了那儿，不用指望成为牛人，但至少你知道大海有多宽，能看到牛人在做什么，就够了。<br />对乌龟来讲，兔子存在的意义在于，至少让它知道这世界还有“兔子”的存在，以及兔子跑得有多快。盗用一句标语：让你看到更大的世界，这本身就是最大的意义。<br />2、兔子的存在，能够让乌龟直面自己就是一只乌龟这个事实。有勇气面对真实的自己，才能准确的定位自己的位置，也才能冷静的思考最适合自己的人生规划。而这，很多时候恰恰是最知易行难的事。<br />3、其实人越往后走，越会深刻体会到“阶级”的不可逾越性。愤青的时候会咒骂：“这世界为什么这么不公平。”可当你不再被荷尔蒙冲昏头脑时，也许你会开始思考：既然现在是这种情况，那我应该做点什么呢？当你绞尽心机让自己变得更好的同时，也许你也在让这个世界变得更好。</p><p>当樱木花道完成两万球的训练之后，他才知道流川枫有多厉害。<br />因为在一次比赛中，他看到流川枫的一个中投，这个起跳，这个姿势，这个弧线，竟然是他训练中想象的最完美的画面。<br />他很气，紧握这拳头，又不甘心，他问教练：这只狐狸是从什么时候开始打篮球的？<br />安西教练：你应该好好的盯着流川枫的姿势，尽可能的模仿他，然后用3倍于他的训练量训练。这样，你才有可能在高中阶段之内超越他。<br />流川枫是那只兔子，幸运的是，樱木大概也是。</p><p>题主的困惑在于，樱木是个天才，尚且如此，而你，可能只是木暮。<br />李宗盛有一首歌，歌词是这样的：最近比较烦比较烦比较烦，我看那远方怎么也看不到岸，那个后面还有一班天才追赶，写一首皆大欢喜的歌，是越来越难。</p><p>中年危机全都是这样的：<br />前面比你牛逼的人一眼都望不到岸，后面一班天才，比你有精力，比你聪明，比你学历高，比你国际化。而你，小孩成绩你得操心，老婆吃秘书的醋你也得操心，父母身体逐渐糟糕，最可怕的是你头发越来越少，身体越来越胖。</p><p>题主的困惑在于，比你天才的那个人，还比你努力；比题主的困惑更可怕的是，这个比你努力的天才，还比你年轻，比你有精力，这意味着，即使你想努力，你也没有那个精力努力。这就更无力了。</p><p>《蜗居》里面，宋思明想抢郭海藻。他比小贝成熟、稳重、懂得女孩的心思，样貌也不差；他有钱，有人际，能帮海藻解决问题。<br />若是宋思明未婚，小贝拿什么跟人家拼？小贝可能一辈子都达不到宋思明的高度，即使拼尽全力。<br />这才是无力感。<br />所以，我们能做什么。</p><p>如果你是个绝对的蠢蛋，那我只能说，请你尽量少的认识这个世界，最好一辈子不要离开你生活的地方，有时候知道的越多，越痛苦。当你看到那么繁华的城市，那么美丽的女孩，那么高端大气上档次的生活都与你无关的时候，更多的痛苦便会袭来。<br />如果你是个笨蛋，又不肯努力，那也请你知道少一点。<br />如果你不是个绝对的蠢蛋，又愿意努力，请你参考第一段安西老师的话：盯着那只兔子的每一个动作，能学多少学多少，然后以他三倍的训练量训练。</p><p>兔子一定会打盹的，即使牛逼如牛顿，30岁之后也再无建树；也不是每个像科比一样的天才，都知道洛杉矶凌晨四点的样子；你知道洛克李吗？火影里那个相信笨鸟先飞的热血少年，他说，努力的天才也是天才。<br />我曾经在一个答案中说过，勤奋，可能是这个世界上最被高估的美德。但是对于一个毫无天赋的人来讲，可以依仗的就只有勤奋了。</p><p>如此，即便你还是追不上兔子，你可以是乌龟里跑得快的那一个。<br />如此，即便你是木暮，你也能做成一个，每天都比昨天好一点点的木暮。</p></blockquote>]]></content>
